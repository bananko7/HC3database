T.S. Elliot 's \" The Wasteland \" What is he trying to say , and what allusions is he making , to what end ? Explain like I'm five.<>This can not be explained - like - you're - five . People have built whole * careers * in the literary arts doing nothing but studying * The Waste Land . * Doctoral theses have been written about it , and there 's no sign that anybody 's close to the bottom of that particular well . Sorry .<>\"The Waste Land\" is a long and complex poem by T.S. Eliot that explores the theme of disillusionment and the search for meaning in a world that seems spiritually and culturally barren or \"waste.\" The poem is structured around a series of interconnected fragments or \"visions\" that draw on a wide range of cultural and literary references, including mythology, religion, and history.\n\nOne of the main allusions in the poem is to the myth of the Fisher King, who represents the wounded or sterile king of the Arthurian legend. The Fisher King is unable to find meaning or purpose in his life and is unable to produce an heir, and this symbolizes the spiritual and cultural emptiness that Eliot sees in the modern world.\n\nAnother important allusion in the poem is to the myth of the Tower of Babel, which refers to the story in the Bible in which God confused the languages of the people who were trying to build a tower to reach heaven. This allusion is meant to suggest that the modern world is fragmented and disconnected, with people speaking different languages and having different cultural experiences, and that this makes it difficult for people to understand each other or find common ground.\n\nOverall, Eliot's \"The Waste Land\" is a deeply philosophical and introspective poem that grapples with some of the big questions of life, such as the nature of meaning, the search for connection, and the possibility of redemption. It is a challenging and complex work that requires careful reading and interpretation, but its themes and ideas are still relevant and thought-provoking today.<>reddit_eli5
