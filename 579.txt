Why ca n't we use magnets as a source of energy ? I 've always thought cars should have magnetic strips and roads should have magnets . Then you can accelerate and brake by turning the magnet to the opposite polar ends . Excuse my ignorance . Explain like I'm five.<>Here 's a thought experiment : What if you put one magnet in the road and one in your car ? The car will get stuck on top of the magnet . In order to move on , to presumably the next magnet in the road , you need to turn the magnet in the car again . But the energy needed to turn the magnet is the same energy that is needed to move the car from one magnet to the next . So you 're not using the magnets as an energy source , you 're just using it as a way to convert the turning of the magnet into motion of the car .<>Magnets can be used to generate electricity, but they are not a very practical source of energy for cars. There are several reasons for this:\r\n\r\nMagnets can only generate electricity when they are moving. In order to use magnets to power a car, you would need to constantly move the magnets, which is difficult and inefficient.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to build a road with magnets that is strong enough to support the weight of a car.\r\n\r\nThe electricity generated by magnets is not very strong, so you would need a lot of magnets to power a car. This would make the car heavy and difficult to drive.\r\n\r\nFinally, magnets can only generate electricity if they are moving through a conductor, such as copper wire. This means that you would need to have a lot of wires on the road, which would be expensive and impractical.\r\n\r\nOverall, while it is theoretically possible to use magnets to power a car, there are much more practical and efficient ways to generate electricity for transportation.<>reddit_eli5
