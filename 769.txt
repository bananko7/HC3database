Why did humanity develop allergies if they are n't beneficial to survival Is humanity also stupid at evolving ? Or were allergies always part of us . And are there any benefits to having allergies ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Evolution leads to incremental improvements , it does n't mean every species is perfectly adapted . Humans are * enormously * complex systems , and there are going to be errors in how our bodies respond to things . In the case of allergies , it 's an immune system being too sensitive and responding to non - threats , which is better than one that is too passive and does n't respond to real threats .<>Allergies are a type of immune system reaction that occurs when the body mistakes a normally harmless substance, such as pollen or peanuts, for a harmful invader. When this happens, the body releases chemicals called histamines in an attempt to protect itself, which can cause symptoms like sneezing, itchy eyes, and trouble breathing. \nIt's not clear why some people develop allergies and others don't. It's thought that a combination of genetic and environmental factors may play a role. For example, people who have a family history of allergies may be more likely to develop them, and certain environmental exposures (such as being exposed to cigarette smoke or pollution) may also increase the risk. \nIt's also not clear whether allergies are beneficial or not. Some scientists believe that allergies may have evolved as a way to protect against certain parasites or infections, but this is still an area of active research and debate. \nThere are some potential benefits to having allergies, such as increased sensitivity to certain substances or a heightened immune response. However, allergies can also be very disruptive to daily life and can cause significant discomfort or even be life-threatening in severe cases.<>reddit_eli5
