Investing in USD from the Eurozone (Jan 2015)<>No, this is not solid advice. It's a prediction with very little factual basis, since US interest rates are kept just as low and debt levels are just as high as in the Eurozone. The USD may rise or fall against the EUR, stay the same or move back and forth. Nobody can say with any certainty. However, it is not nearly as risky as \"normal forex speculation\", since that is usually very short term and highly leveraged. You're unlikely to lose more than 20-30% of your capital by just buying and holding USD. Of course, the potential gains are also limited.<>If you are in the Eurozone and are considering investing in the United States dollar (USD), there are a few things you should consider.First, you should consider the exchange rate between the euro and the USD. The exchange rate will affect the value of your investment in USD, as well as any returns you may earn. If the exchange rate is favorable, it may be a good time to invest in USD. However, if the exchange rate is not favorable, you may want to consider waiting until the exchange rate improves or looking at other investment options.It's also important to consider the economic conditions in both the Eurozone and the United States. If the economic conditions are favorable in the United States, it may be a good time to invest in USD. However, if the economic conditions are not favorable in the United States, it may be wise to wait until the conditions improve or consider other investment options.Finally, you should consider your personal financial situation and investment goals. Are you comfortable with the level of risk associated with investing in the USD? Do you have a diversified investment portfolio? Are you investing for the short-term or the long-term? Answering these questions can help you determine if investing in USD is the right choice for you.<>If you are in the Eurozone and are considering investing in the United States dollar (USD), there are a few things you should consider.First, you should consider the exchange rate between the euro and the USD.
