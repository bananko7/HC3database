How can forensics tie a bullet to a specific firearm ? Can forensics tie a bullet to a specific gun ? like a 9 mm bullet from glock 19 # 1234 . Can forensic science actually do that or is it hollywood bs ? Explain like I'm five. <>It 's Hollywood BS . A comparison to a ballistic forensics database has never yielded a positive match ( Maryland has maintained one for years and gotten no tangible benefit from it ) . A US National Research Council Study concluded ( from [ wikipedia ] ( URL_0 ): > The United States National Research Council released a report in 2008 that endorsed the investigation of microstamping as an alternative to ballistic markings . * * It had concluded that a national database of ballistic markings is unworkable and that there is not enough scientific evidence that , \" every gun leaves microscopic marks on bullets and cartridge cases that are unique to that weapon and remain the same over repeated firings \" . * * It described microstamping as a \" promising method \" that could \" attain the same basic goal as the proposed database\".[14 ] Microstamping is the laser etching of unique identifiers onto the firing pin , and it has independent problems of its own ; namely that firing pins are a bit like tires , they 're an easily changed consumable on most firearms like tire is a consumable on cars -- it 's like requiring laser etching on tires so you can more easily identify what car was used in a crime .<>Forensic scientists can sometimes tie a bullet to a specific firearm by examining the markings that the gun leaves on the bullet as it is fired. These markings, called \"toolmarks,\" are unique to each firearm and can be used to identify the gun that fired the bullet.\\n\\nTo do this, the forensic scientist will use a microscope to examine the bullet and compare the toolmarks to those made by known firearms. If the toolmarks on the bullet match those made by a particular firearm, the forensic scientist can conclude that the bullet was likely fired from that gun.\\n\\nIt's important to note that this process is not always foolproof, and there are limits to the precision with which a bullet can be tied to a specific firearm. However, in some cases, it can be a valuable piece of evidence in a criminal investigation.<>reddit_eli5
