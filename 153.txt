why do our breaths get 20x worse while we sleep ? I 've always questioned this , so the question is why ? Even after brushing your teeth you go to sleep and overnight you magically get bad breath . Is there something we do when we sleep ? Explain like I'm five.<>An elementary - non biologist answer : While we sleep our mouths are n't generally open or taking in any food . Because of the lack gases , ( oxygen ) , liquids , and solids , our mouths essentially become a breeding ground for bacteria and germs that cause bad breath .<>When we sleep, our bodies produce less saliva, which helps to keep our mouths moist and wash away bacteria and food particles that can cause bad breath. Without enough saliva, bacteria in our mouths can grow and produce smelly substances that can cause bad breath. Additionally, when we sleep, we tend to breathe through our mouths more, which can dry out our mouths and contribute to bad breath. Finally, as we sleep, our bodies are repairing and regenerating tissues, including the tissues in our mouths, which can produce substances that can cause bad breath. So, a combination of less saliva, mouth breathing, and tissue repair can all contribute to bad breath while we sleep.<>reddit_eli5
