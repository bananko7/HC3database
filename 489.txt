Dr.Olgeta Xhufka ( general and family physician ).<>It is generally not likely that a spider bite could cause an infection in a knee replacement. Spider bites typically do not introduce bacteria into the body, which is the main cause of infections.\n\nHowever, it is possible that a spider bite could cause an allergic reaction or inflammation in the affected area, which could potentially affect the knee if the bite occurred close to the knee. In such cases, it would be important to seek medical attention and follow your doctor's recommendations for treatment.\n\nIf you are concerned about the possibility of an infection in your knee replacement, it is important to consult with a medical professional. They will be able to examine the affected area and determine the appropriate course of treatment based on your specific circumstances.<>medicine
