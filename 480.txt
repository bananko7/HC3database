What is the purpose of a private drive ? There 's a little stretch of road in my neighborhood labeled \" private drive \" , and connects a few houses . What 's the point of the city appointing such a road private ? Explain like I'm five. <>it means the road is not built by the government , but rather by the little neighborhood division . if you drive there without being asked to be there , it 's trespassing . whereas public roads , you can drive on for no reason . also means that the division put up the money to build and maintain the road<>A private drive is a road or path that is privately owned and maintained, rather than being owned and maintained by a government agency such as a city or county. This means that the people who live on or use the road are responsible for keeping it in good repair and paying for any necessary maintenance or improvements. Private drives are often used to provide access to a small group of houses or other buildings, such as a gated community or a residential development. In some cases, private drives may be restricted to certain types of traffic or may be closed to the public. The purpose of labeling a road as a private drive is to let people know that it is not a public road and that they may not be able to use it without permission from the owner.<>reddit_eli5
