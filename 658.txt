How can light not escape a black hole If light is made of photons , and photons have no mass how does a black hole 's gravitational pull affect said light ? Explain like I'm five.<>Gravity does not come solely from mass . That may be what Newton thought , but as it turns out , it comes mostly from energy , and matter is a type of energy . Light is not matter . But it * is * energy , so it is affected by gravity . When body A orbits body B at a particular height , A must circle B at the correct speed to stay in that orbit . Lower orbits are faster orbits , and vice versa . With black holes , there is a particular height(called the Event Horizon ) at which the orbital velocity is the speed of light . If anything is closer to the black hole than that height , it can not orbit , and will inevitably spiral to the center .<>Black holes are objects with extremely strong gravitational pull, so strong that not even light can escape from them. This is because the gravitational pull of a black hole is determined by its mass, and the more massive an object is, the stronger its gravitational pull will be. Since photons (which make up light) have no mass, you might be wondering how they can be affected by the gravitational pull of a black hole.\r\n\r\nWell, even though photons don't have mass, they do have energy, and energy can be affected by gravity. So when a photon gets too close to a black hole, the black hole's strong gravitational pull can bend the path of the photon and cause it to be sucked into the black hole. This is what makes it so difficult for light to escape from a black hole - it's being pulled in by the black hole's powerful gravity.\r\n\r\nI hope that helps to explain it! Let me know if you have any other questions.<>reddit_eli5
