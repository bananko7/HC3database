How come I do n't see posts in other languages on reddit ? Does reddit automatically translate posts according to region or do people post in english for simplicity ? Are default subreddits versions for different languages ? Explain like I'm five.<>Mostly because nearly all of reddit speaks English , so no one posts in anything other than English<>On Reddit, people can post in any language they want. However, the language that a post is written in is often determined by the subreddit (a community on Reddit centered around a specific topic) that it is posted in. Some subreddits are specifically for people who speak a certain language, so most of the posts in those subreddits will be written in that language. For example, there might be a subreddit for people who speak Spanish, where most of the posts are written in Spanish.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are also many subreddits that are open to people from all over the world, regardless of the language they speak. In these subreddits, you might see posts written in a variety of different languages. Reddit does not automatically translate these posts, so you might not be able to understand a post if it is written in a language that you do not speak.\r\n\r\nTo sum it up, people on Reddit can post in any language they want, but the language that a post is written in is often determined by the subreddit it is posted in. If you want to see posts in a specific language, you can try looking for subreddits that are specifically for people who speak that language.<>reddit_eli5
