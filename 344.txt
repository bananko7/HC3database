What happens when you \" double bounce \" somebody on a trampoline ? How and why does it work ? Thanks Please explain like I'm five.<>When the first person jumps they begin their upward momentum when they are still in contact with the trampoline surface but with upward momentum the second person jumps down . This action will apply tension to the trampoline surface effectively pushing all other areas of the trampoline upward which will propel the first person upward with more force than if they were to continue upward under the initial force of the jump<>When you \"double bounce\" someone on a trampoline, it means that you jump on the trampoline and then bounce someone else off of it by pushing them with your feet or hands. Here's how it works: when you jump on a trampoline, your weight causes the trampoline to stretch and then bounce back up. When you bounce someone else off of the trampoline, you are adding more weight to the trampoline, which causes it to stretch even more and then bounce back up even higher. This is why it feels like you are being launched into the air when you are double bounced. It's important to be careful when double bouncing because it can be dangerous if you are not careful. Make sure to follow all safety guidelines and rules when using a trampoline, and never push someone off of a trampoline if they don't want to be pushed.<>reddit_eli5
