A gigabyte , or the concept of bytes . I tried to explain a gigabyte to someone today and I found myself unable to do so . Maybe one of you guys could help me out ? Explain like I'm five.<>A bit is an on \/ off switch , zero or 1 . A byte is 8 bits , so a byte would look something like 00110010 . A kilobyte is 1024 of those , a megabyte is 1024 of those , and a gigabyte is 1024 of those . So a gb is 1024 ^ 3 bytes .<>Sure! A gigabyte is a unit of measurement for data. It's used to measure how much data can be stored on a device, like a computer or phone, or how much data is being transferred over the internet. Imagine you have a bucket. Each time you add something to the bucket, it gets bigger. A byte is like one tiny thing that you can add to the bucket. A gigabyte is like adding a whole bunch of those tiny things to the bucket all at once. So if you have a device that can hold 1 gigabyte of data, it means it can hold a whole bunch of tiny things – or data – in it. That might be pictures, music, or even words that you've written. Does that help explain it?<>reddit_eli5
