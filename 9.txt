how countries like Taiwan , Kosovo , etc operate . Countries like this are claimed my other countries ( such as China ) . How does it work ? How do laws get passed ? Trade ? Benefits ( or other government things ) ? Please explain like I'm five.<>In the case of Taiwan , China 's ( People 's Republic of China \/ PRC ) official policy is essentially \" one country , two systems . \" Under this policy , Taiwan ( as well as Hong Kong and Macau ) are technically considered territories of the PRC , but are allowed to operate with a high level of autonomy , maintaining their own political and economic systems . So China does not actively try to interfere with Taiwan 's governance , but does maintain that it is a territory of China and not a separate nation . Taiwan ( Republic of China \/ ROC ) rejects this policy . There are two main factions in Taiwan : one that supports unification with China ( i.e. asserting that the ROC is the true sovereign government of both countries ) and one that supports independence ( i.e. that China and Taiwan should be two separate nations ) .<>Taiwan and Kosovo are both countries that are not recognized by all other countries in the world as independent states. This means that some countries do not think they should be treated as fully-fledged countries, and may instead consider them to be part of other countries (in the case of Taiwan, China claims it as part of its territory, while Kosovo is partially recognized as independent by some countries but not by others).Despite this, both Taiwan and Kosovo have governments that make laws and operate just like any other country. In Taiwan, people elect a president and legislators who make laws and represent the people's interests. In Kosovo, people elect a president and members of parliament who do the same. These governments also provide services to the people living in the country, such as education and healthcare, and work to promote trade and other economic activities.It can be challenging for Taiwan and Kosovo to fully participate in the global community, because some other countries do not recognize them as independent states. This can make it difficult for them to establish diplomatic relations or to join international organizations. However, both countries have still been able to build relationships with many other countries and have active economies despite these challenges.<>reddit_eli5
