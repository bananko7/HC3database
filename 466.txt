How can movies like ' The Possesion ' about a moth demon growing inside a child claim to be ' based on a true story ' ? Movie here : URL_0 Explain like I'm five.<>a ) It could be VERY loosely based , but still be ' based on ' . This is a marketing gimmick . b ) It 's based on one specific version of the story . See \" The Exorcism of Emily Rose \" . She has a condition where her body locks up in very odd , somewhat terrifying poses . The doctors say it 's one thing , the priest says it 's the other . Which one do you think makes for a better horror movie ?<>Movies that are advertised as being \"based on a true story\" are often inspired by real events, but they may also include fictional elements or creative license in the storytelling. This means that while some parts of the movie may be based on real events, other parts may be entirely made up or exaggerated for dramatic effect.\n\nIn the case of \"The Possession,\" the movie is inspired by the true story of a dybbuk box, which is a type of Jewish folklore. According to legend, a dybbuk is a malevolent spirit that can possess a person's body. In the movie, the story of the dybbuk box is used as the basis for the plot, but it is likely that many of the details and events depicted in the movie are not based on actual events.\n\nIt's important to remember that movies are entertainment and are not always meant to be taken as literal representations of reality. Just because a movie is advertised as being \"based on a true story\" doesn't mean that every aspect of the movie is completely accurate.<>reddit_eli5
