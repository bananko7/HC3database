Please explain what is \"Probability theory\"<>Probability theory is the branch of mathematics concerned with probability. Although there are several different probability interpretations, probability theory treats the concept in a rigorous mathematical manner by expressing it through a set of axioms. Typically these axioms formalise probability in terms of a probability space, which assigns a measure taking values between 0 and 1, termed the probability measure, to a set of outcomes called the sample space. Any specified subset of the sample space is called an event.\nCentral subjects in probability theory include discrete and continuous random variables, probability distributions, and stochastic processes (which provide mathematical abstractions of non-deterministic or uncertain processes or measured quantities that may either be single occurrences or evolve over time in a random fashion).\nAlthough it is not possible to perfectly predict random events, much can be said about their behavior. Two major results in probability theory describing such behaviour are the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem.\nAs a mathematical foundation for statistics, probability theory is essential to many human activities that involve quantitative analysis of data. Methods of probability theory also apply to descriptions of complex systems given only partial knowledge of their state, as in statistical mechanics or sequential estimation. A great discovery of twentieth-century physics was the probabilistic nature of physical phenomena at atomic scales, described in quantum mechanics.<>Probability theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of random events and the likelihood of their occurrence. It is used to model and analyze uncertain situations, such as the outcome of a coin toss or the outcome of a medical trial.\n\n\n\nIn probability theory, events are assigned probabilities, which are numerical values that reflect the likelihood of the event occurring. These probabilities are typically expressed as decimal values between 0 and 1, with 0 representing an impossible event and 1 representing a certain event. For example, the probability of flipping a coin and it landing on heads is 0.5, because there is an equal chance of either outcome occurring.\n\n\n\nProbability theory is used in a wide range of fields, including finance, engineering, and the natural and social sciences. It is a fundamental tool for making decisions under uncertainty and for understanding and predicting the behavior of complex systems.<>wiki_csai
