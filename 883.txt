Why is HF so dangerous when it 's a fairly weak acid ? From my chemistry knowledge HF is weaker than HCl yet it is common to find bench grade HCl , why is n't it the same with HF ? Explain like I'm five. <>We often used high concentration HF acid to etch and structure glass ( quartz \/ borofloat \/ pyrex ) in the cleanroom I used to work . From a chemical perspective HF is incredibly dangerous because it easily penetrates your skin and starts interfering with some of your biological processes . Among other things it binds to calcium ions in your blood , which hinders cell metabolism and may cause cardiac arrest ( rule of thumb was that a 10x10 cm exposure area was potentially fatal ) . I also seem to recall being told it may react with the calcium in your bones and make your bones brittle beyond repair around the exposure area , but I am not sure and fortunately we had no accidents during the time I worked there .<>Hydrofluoric acid (HF) is a weak acid, but it is still dangerous to handle because it can cause serious harm to your body. When HF comes into contact with your skin, it can easily penetrate through your skin and into your bones, causing serious damage. It can also be harmful if you inhale the vapors or swallow it.\\n\\nOne reason that HF is not as commonly found in bench-grade form is that it is more expensive to produce than other acids, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl). Additionally, HF is more dangerous to handle and requires special precautions, such as protective clothing and equipment, when working with it. This makes it less practical for use in some situations.\\n\\nIt's important to always use caution when working with any chemical, and to follow proper safety procedures to protect yourself and others.<>reddit_eli5
