Is it possible to go faster than another object in the same orbit as you ? Title says all . It does n't make sense in my head but I just want to know lol . Please explain like I'm five.<>Not without constant thrusting , otherwise you would be in a different orbit . Higher orbits come from moving faster .<>Yes, it is possible to go faster than another object that is in the same orbit as you. To understand why, it might help to think about what it means to be in orbit around something.Imagine you are standing on a big hill, and you roll a ball down the hill. As the ball rolls down the hill, it picks up speed. But as it gets closer to the bottom of the hill, it starts to slow down again. This is because the ground is pulling the ball towards it with gravity.Now imagine that instead of rolling down a hill, the ball is orbiting around the Earth. The ball is still being pulled towards the Earth with gravity, just like it was when it was rolling down the hill. But because the ball is moving so fast, it never actually hits the ground. It just keeps going around and around in a circle.This circle that the ball is moving in is called an orbit. So when you are in orbit around something, you are just moving in a big circle around it.Now, let's say that you and a friend are both standing on the big hill, and you both roll a ball at the same time. If you both roll your balls at the same speed, then your balls will stay right next to each other as they roll down the hill. But if you roll your ball a little bit faster than your friend, then your ball will start to pull ahead of your friend's ball.It's the same way with objects that are in orbit. If two objects are in the same orbit and one of them is going a little bit faster than the other, then it will start to pull ahead of the other object. So it is possible to go faster than another object that is in the same orbit as you.<>reddit_eli5
