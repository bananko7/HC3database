Whatever happened to Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 ? I have n't heard any news about the missing plane in months . Did the search teams find anything linking to it yet ? I 'm surprised at how the topic has suddenly disappeared from the news . Please explain like I'm five.<>There has n't been any new information to report . If there were , we 'd have known about it , but they ca n't just stay on the news 24 hours a day saying \" Well ... nothing new yet . \" CNN tried for a while , granted .<>Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 was a passenger flight that disappeared on March 8, 2014, while flying from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, China. The plane was carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew members. Despite an extensive search and rescue effort, the plane has not been found and its whereabouts remain a mystery. There have been several theories about what happened to the plane, but so far, no concrete evidence has been found to explain its disappearance. Some experts believe that the plane may have crashed into the ocean, while others think it may have landed somewhere and is being hidden. The search for the missing plane has involved teams from several countries, including Malaysia, China, and Australia. They have searched vast areas of the Indian Ocean, but so far, they have not found any trace of the plane or its passengers. It is not uncommon for news about missing planes or other mysteries to fade from the headlines after a period of time. However, the families of the passengers and crew members on Flight MH370 have not given up hope of finding out what happened to their loved ones, and the search for the missing plane continues.<>reddit_eli5
