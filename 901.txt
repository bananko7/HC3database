How come the government takes my taxes away from my paycheck if they 're just going to give me some \/ a majority of the money back ? Why not just NOT take the money out if I 'm in a certain tax bracket ? Explain like I'm five.<>The taxes taken out of your paycheck are estimates based on your income and how many exemptions you choose to elect . When you 're filling out your taxes , you add additional deductions ( which reduce your tax burden ) that you can not know about paycheck to paycheck . You math out all the numbers , and find out how much you * actually * owe . If that number differs than the sum of what they took out of your check , either you owe them money , or they owe you money . Taxes are , basically , settling up your yearly bill with the government .<>The government takes taxes out of your paycheck because they need money to fund various programs and services that benefit the country and its citizens. These programs and services include things like schools, roads, hospitals, and the military. The government also uses the money it collects from taxes to provide assistance to those in need, such as through unemployment benefits or food assistance programs.\r\n\r\nWhen you file your taxes, you have the opportunity to claim credits or deductions that can reduce the amount of tax you owe. If you are eligible for these credits or deductions, you may get some or all of the money you paid in taxes back as a refund.\r\n\r\nThe government has a progressive tax system, which means that people with higher incomes pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than those with lower incomes. This is why you might see your paycheck shrink a little bit each pay period because of taxes: the government is taking out a percentage of your income to help fund the programs and services it provides.<>reddit_eli5
