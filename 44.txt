Why is Genghis Khan remembered as a great hero , or at least conqueror if he murdered 40m+ people ? It seems to me he should considered worse than Hitler . Please explain like I'm five.<>Well he was certainly a conqueror -no questions there . as for Great Hero ? He is usually portrayed as a merciless tyrant .<>Genghis Khan is remembered as a great conqueror because he was able to unite the tribes of the Mongolian steppe and create the Mongol Empire, which was the largest contiguous land empire in history. He was also able to create a system of government that allowed the different peoples of the empire to live together in relative peace and prosperity. \nHowever, it is important to note that Genghis Khan and his armies also committed many brutal acts of violence, including the murder of millions of people, during their conquests. While Genghis Khan is often admired for his military tactics and leadership abilities, it is not right to overlook or downplay the suffering that he and his armies inflicted on many people. It is important to remember both the good and the bad when thinking about historical figures like Genghis Khan.<>reddit_eli5
