How does NASA 's EmDrive work and why is it controversial ? Edit : It 's not NASA 's . Please explain like I'm five.<>Every space engine works by throwing stuff out the back . Rockets throw the burnt stuff out the back . Ion thrusters throw xenon or other gases out the back . But they all throw something out the back . The EM drive does n't throw stuff out the back , but it can still make the space craft go forwards , even though it only goes forward a little bit . So it 's either a small experimental error , or most of physics is wrong . If the EM drive works , then a lot of people are going to have to rework physics , if they are n't to busy building a probe that goes to Alpha Centuri or something else amazing .<>The EmDrive is a type of propulsion system that is being developed by some researchers. It is supposed to be able to propel a spacecraft without the need for any type of fuel. Instead, it would use something called \"microwave cavities\" to create thrust. The idea is that if you put microwaves into a specially shaped metal container, the microwaves will bounce around and push against the walls of the container, creating a force. Some people think that this force could be used to move a spacecraft.The EmDrive is controversial because it goes against one of the most basic laws of physics, which is that you can't get something for nothing. According to this law, if you want to make something move, you have to push against something else. For example, if you want to push a box across the floor, you have to push against the floor. The EmDrive doesn't have anything to push against, so it shouldn't be able to work. However, some researchers have claimed that they have seen the EmDrive produce a small amount of thrust in their experiments, which would mean that the law of physics is wrong.<>reddit_eli5
