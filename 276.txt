How could I find someone to find a room for me to live in? (For a fee, of course.)<>There are services, usually associated with real estate agents, that provide apartment search services for relocating professionals. I was very underimpressed when I was offered the use of such a service and did better on my own, but I did have the company paying for a hotel room while I searched so I had time to investigate alternative channels -- and in fact found and took a place being offered by a co-worker's father. But if you're really looking for \"a room\" in a shared living situation, and you aren't already on campus talking to other students, I agree that the school's housing office, or the dorms and\/or fraternity houses and\/or independent living groups are your best bet.  In a college town most roommate openings get snapped up pretty quickly and are more likely to go to someone who is a known or vouched-for quantity.<>There are a few options you might consider for finding someone to help you find a room to live in for a fee:Property management company: Many property management companies offer rental search services for a fee.
