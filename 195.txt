This is often done as a surprise move in an attempt to score a run without the defense being able to throw the runner out. It is a risky play because the runner is vulnerable to being tagged out if the catcher can get the ball to the pitcher in time.\n\nStealing home is a relatively rare play in baseball, and it is generally only done in certain circumstances. For example, a runner might try to steal home if the pitcher is not paying attention and the catcher is not in position to throw the runner out. It can also be done as a strategic move to try to catch the defense off guard and score a run.\n\nOverall, stealing home is a high-risk, high-reward play that can be exciting for fans to watch. It is not something that is done frequently, but it can be a thrilling moment in a baseball game when it does happen.<>reddit_eli5
