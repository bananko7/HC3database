if the downside to global warming is that the polar ice caps will melt and flood the earth , why do n't we create a bunch of crater lakes in rural areas of countries and feed the excess water to them ? Like a big drainage ditch Explain like I'm five.<>You 're * way * underestimating the quantity of water we 're talking about .<>Well, creating crater lakes in rural areas wouldn't really help with the problem of polar ice melting and causing sea levels to rise. The ice that is melting is coming from the polar regions, which are very far away from most rural areas.\r\n\r\nEven if we could somehow transport all of the melting ice to these rural areas and fill up the crater lakes, the water would eventually find its way back to the sea. So while it might help a little bit in the short term, it wouldn't be a permanent solution to the problem.\r\n\r\nA better solution would be to try to reduce the amount of heat that is being trapped in the Earth's atmosphere, which is causing the polar ice to melt in the first place. This can be done by using cleaner energy sources, like wind and solar power, and by finding ways to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide that we are putting into the air.<>reddit_eli5
