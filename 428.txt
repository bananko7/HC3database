How did Felix Baumgartner break the sound barrier ? Would n't he just fall at terminal velocity ? Explain like I'm five.<>In a vacuum , all things fall at the same rate of speed . In the stratosphere he was in , the lack of pressure essentially put him in a vacuum . For the first 30 seconds he was falling extremely fast ( over 700 mph ) because the distance of the ' vacuum ' allowed such speed to be gained . You 'll notice after about 30 seconds he eventually was n't doing a death tumble but gained control over his falling . He gradually exited the ' vacuum ' into pressurized area , which slowed him down and gave him control .<>Felix Baumgartner broke the sound barrier when he jumped out of a balloon from a height of around 39 kilometers (24 miles) above the Earth's surface. When he first jumped out of the balloon, he did not break the sound barrier because he was falling at a speed close to terminal velocity, which is the maximum speed that a person can reach while falling through the air. However, as he continued to fall, the air around him thinned out, allowing him to accelerate more and more. Eventually, he reached a speed of about 1,342 kilometers per hour (834 miles per hour), which is faster than the speed of sound. This is why he was able to break the sound barrier.\n\nTo explain it like you're five: Felix jumped out of a really high balloon and fell very fast. As he fell, the air around him got thinner and thinner, so he was able to go faster and faster. Eventually, he went faster than the speed of sound, which is a very fast speed that you can't hear.<>reddit_eli5
