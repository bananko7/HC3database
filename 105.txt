Why is bird feces white but all other animals are brown ? I know I could look it up but Google wo n't explain it like I 'm 5 so Explain like I'm five.<>Bird 's excrement is actually a combination of their \" urine \" and feces . Birds do n't \" pee \" like mammals , they excrete all waste from the same orifice called a \" cloaca , \" which is like a fancy butthole . The white junk is nitrogen and urea and other stuff that would normally be excreted in urine in other animals .<>\\nBirds have a different type of digestive system than most other animals. Instead of having a long intestine like humans and other mammals, birds have a short intestine and a special organ called a gizzard. The gizzard is a muscular part of the stomach that helps grind up the food the bird eats.\\n\\nBirds also have a different type of excrement than mammals. Instead of solid feces, birds produce a liquid called uric acid. This liquid is white and is mixed with the bird's solid waste to form the bird's excrement.\\n\\nSo, the main reason that bird feces is white is because it is made up of a liquid called uric acid. Other animals have a different type of digestive system and produce solid feces, which is typically brown in color.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<>reddit_eli5
