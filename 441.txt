Why does it seem like the older I get the faster time speeds up ? For example , middle and high school seemed like it lasted forever but college felt like it was over in a flash . Why ? Explain like I'm five.<>As each year passes , it is a smaller.percentage of your total life than any of the years that came before it . When you are five , a year is 20 % of the time you have lived . By the time you are fifty , it is only 2 % .<>As we grow older, our brains and bodies change in ways that can make time feel like it's moving faster. One reason time might seem to speed up as we age is because we have more experiences and we have a stronger sense of the passage of time. When we're younger, we may not have as many experiences, so each day and week may feel longer because there is less to compare it to. As we get older and have more experiences, each day and week may feel shorter because we have more reference points to compare them to.\n\nAnother reason time might seem to go by faster as we age is because our brains become more efficient at processing information. This means that we may be able to do things more quickly and with less effort, which can make time feel like it's passing more quickly.\n\nIt's also worth noting that as we get older, we tend to have more responsibilities and obligations, which can make the days feel shorter because we're busy and don't have as much free time.\n\nFinally, it's worth mentioning that our perception of time is also influenced by our emotional state. If we're having a good time and enjoying ourselves, time may seem to go by more slowly. If we're stressed or anxious, time may seem to go by more quickly.<>reddit_eli5
