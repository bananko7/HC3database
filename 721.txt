Explain like I'm five.<>Oxytocin , dopamine , serotonin is what happened .<>I'm sorry to hear about your dog. It's natural to feel a range of emotions after a loss, and crying can be a way to express and release those emotions. Sometimes people feel better after crying because it can be a way to let go of built-up emotions and can be a form of self-soothing. Crying can also stimulate the production of endorphins, which are chemicals in the brain that can help to reduce pain and increase feelings of pleasure. So it's possible that the endorphins produced during crying are contributing to the good feelings you're experiencing.<>reddit_eli5
