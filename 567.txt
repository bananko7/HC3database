The differences between the various specialties within Engineering . Computer vs Software vs Mechanical vs Electrical vs Civil vs Environmental vs others ? Explain like I'm five. <>They apply engineering processes to different parts of the system 's design . Computer = processing hardware Software = code Mechanical = moving parts Electrical = circuits Civil = built structures Environmental = natural structures<>Sure! Engineers are people who design and build things to solve problems. There are many different types of engineering, and each type focuses on a specific area of expertise. Here's a brief overview of some of the most common types of engineering:\\n\\nComputer engineering: Computer engineers design and build computers and computer systems. They work on everything from the hardware (the physical parts of a computer) to the software (the programs and systems that run on a computer).\\n\\nSoftware engineering: Software engineers design and build software applications and systems. They focus on creating programs that are efficient, reliable, and easy to use.\\n\\nMechanical engineering: Mechanical engineers design and build machines and mechanical systems. They work on everything from small machines like watches to large machines like airplanes.\\n\\nElectrical engineering: Electrical engineers design and build electrical systems, such as power grids and electrical circuits. They also work on electronic devices like phones and computers.\\n\\nCivil engineering: Civil engineers design and build infrastructure, such as buildings, roads, and bridges. They also work on water and sewage systems.\\n\\nEnvironmental engineering: Environmental engineers design and build systems to protect the environment and help solve environmental problems, such as pollution and waste management.\\n\\nThere are many other types of engineering as well, such as chemical, aerospace, and biomedical engineering. Each type of engineering involves applying scientific and mathematical principles to solve problems and create new products or systems.<>reddit_eli5
