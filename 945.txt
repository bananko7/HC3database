Please explain what is \"Flocking (behavior)\"<>Flocking is the behaviour exhibited when a group of birds, called a flock, are foraging or in flight.\nComputer simulations and mathematical models that have been developed to emulate the flocking behaviours of birds can also generally be applied to the \"flocking\" behaviour of other species. As a result, the term \"flocking\" is sometimes applied, in computer science, to species other than birds.\nThis article is about the modelling of flocking behaviour. From the perspective of the mathematical modeller, \"flocking\" is the collective motion by a group of self-propelled entities and is a collective animal behaviour exhibited by many living beings such as birds, fish, bacteria, and  insects. It is considered an emergent behaviour arising from simple rules that are followed by individuals and does not involve any central coordination.<>Flocking is a type of coordinated group behavior that is exhibited by animals of various species, including birds, fish, and insects. It is characterized by the ability of the animals to move together in a coordinated and cohesive manner, as if they were a single entity.\n\n\n\nFlocking behavior is thought to have evolved as a way for animals to increase their chances of survival by working together as a group. For example, flocking birds may be able to locate food more efficiently or defend themselves against predators more effectively when they work together. Flocking behavior is also thought to help animals stay together and maintain social bonds.\n\n\n\nThere are several different models that have been proposed to explain the mechanisms behind flocking behavior. One of the most well-known models is the \"boids\" model, which was developed by computer graphics researcher Craig Reynolds in 1986. This model describes the behavior of a flock of birds as being determined by three simple rules: separation (avoiding collisions with other members of the flock), alignment (tending to move in the same direction as other members of the flock), and cohesion (tending to stay close to other members of the flock).\n\n\n\nFlocking behavior has been studied extensively in a variety of fields, including biology, computer science, and engineering. It has also been used as a model for the development of artificial intelligence and robotics, as it provides a simple yet powerful example of how complex group behavior can emerge from simple individual rules.<>wiki_csai
