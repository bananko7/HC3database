What exactly is the internet and who runs it ? Is the internet just ran by one big datacenter ? Or one main datacenter that allows the internet to be a thing ? Please explain like I'm five.
The internet is a bunch of computers owned by different people connected by cables owned by different people . That 's it !
The internet is a vast network of computers and other devices that are connected to each other and can communicate with each other. It's like a giant web of connections that allows people to share information and communicate with each other all around the world. There is no one person or organization that runs the entire internet. Instead, it is made up of many different networks that are owned and operated by different companies, organizations, and even individuals. These networks are all connected to each other, which allows people to access the internet from anywhere in the world. Think of it like a giant highway system. There are many different roads that are owned and maintained by different organizations, but they are all connected together to form a larger network that allows people to travel from one place to another. In the same way, the internet is a network of networks that connects people and devices all around the world.
