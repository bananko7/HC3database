What makes a \" professional \" photographer ? Ca n't anyone buy an expensive camera and take high quality photos ? No disrespect to the pro 's out there . Explain like I'm five.<>Anyone can try ! If you sell one , then you 're a professional photographer . But ... there is real skill . I have gear that is more expensive and \" higher end \" then my photographer friends in many cases , but my very best photo looks as good to my eye as photos they take a dozen times a day . It pisses me off . They have vastly better aesthetic sense and knowledge ( this is a skill , not just some weird genius thing ) , knowledge of light and color , deeper knowledge of how their gear actually works and relates to color and light , and the ability to see in the real world what will translate to their photographs .<>Being a professional photographer is about more than just owning an expensive camera. It's about having the skills, knowledge, and experience to take high-quality photos that meet the needs of your clients or audience.\r\n\r\nProfessional photographers have a good understanding of composition, lighting, and other technical aspects of photography, and they know how to use their cameras and other equipment to get the best results. They also have a keen eye for detail and can use their creative skills to capture interesting and compelling images.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their technical and creative skills, professional photographers also have the business skills and knowledge needed to run a successful photography business. This includes things like marketing, pricing, contracts, and customer service.\r\n\r\nSo while it's certainly possible for anyone to buy an expensive camera and take good photos, being a professional photographer requires a combination of technical, creative, and business skills that takes time and experience to develop.<>reddit_eli5
