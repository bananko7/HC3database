Please explain what is \"Management science\"<>Management science (or managerial science) is a wide and interdisciplinary study of solving complex problems and making strategic decisions as it pertains to institutions, corporations, governments and other types of organizational entities. It is closely related to management, economics, business, engineering, management consulting, and other fields. It uses various scientific research-based principles, strategies, and analytical methods including  mathematical modeling, statistics and numerical algorithms and aims to improve an organization's ability to enact rational and accurate management decisions by arriving at optimal or near optimal solutions to complex decision problems.\nManagement science looks to help businesses achieve goals using a number of scientific methods. The field was initially an outgrowth of applied mathematics, where early challenges were problems relating to the optimization of systems which could be modeled linearly, i.e., determining the optima (maximum value of profit, assembly line performance, crop yield, bandwidth, etc. or minimum of loss, risk, costs, etc.) of some objective function. Today, management science encompasses any organizational activity for which a problem is structured in mathematical form to generate managerially relevant insights.<>Management science is a field of study that uses statistical, mathematical, and computational techniques to analyze and optimize business operations and decision-making. It is often used in conjunction with operations research, which is a similar field that focuses on the use of mathematical modeling and analysis to improve decision-making and problem-solving in complex systems.\n\n\n\nManagement science techniques are used to solve a wide range of problems in business, including resource allocation, scheduling, forecasting, and decision-making under uncertainty. These techniques can help managers to make better decisions, improve efficiency, and increase profitability. They are commonly used in industries such as manufacturing, finance, healthcare, and transportation.\n\n\n\nManagement science involves the use of a wide range of tools and techniques, including linear programming, network analysis, decision analysis, and simulation. It also involves the use of computer software and other advanced technologies to analyze data and develop models for decision-making.\n\n\n\nOverall, the goal of management science is to help organizations make better decisions and improve their operations through the use of rigorous analytical methods.<>wiki_csai
