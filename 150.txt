Why does Japan have such bizarre pornography ? Edit to clarify question : What are the social factors which cause the strange porn ? Also , why so much pubic hair ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Because as long as it resembles a penis but is n't really a penis , it could be anything . Maybe even a penis .<>It's not accurate or fair to say that Japan has particularly \"bizarre\" pornography. Like in any country, there is a range of pornography that is produced and consumed in Japan, and the content of this material varies greatly. There is no single explanation for why some pornography produced in Japan may be perceived as strange or unusual to some people. \nIt's also important to note that pornography is a form of media that is meant to be sexually suggestive or arousing. It is not necessarily intended to reflect real-life relationships or sexual practices. Therefore, it is not appropriate to try to draw conclusions about a society's attitudes towards sex or relationships based on the content of its pornography. \nAs for the presence of pubic hair in Japanese pornography, this is a matter of personal preference and can vary from one individual to another. Some people may prefer to leave their pubic hair unshaved, while others may prefer to shave it. There is no one \"correct\" way to groom pubic hair and what is considered attractive can vary from one culture to another.<>reddit_eli5
