why does my pee come out in a straight line ? I 'm just curious and I do n't know shit about fluid dynamics Explain like I'm five.<>The complete answer is not yet known , but the urine which is 95 % water swirls its way down the urinary tract much like a bullet travelling through the barrel of a gun . This swirling allows the fluid to have a rotational momentum which is preserved as it exits . This provides the fluid a certain amount of stability against the surrounding medium ( air ) and hence the jet comes out linearly ( strictly speaking , parabolic due to gravity ) . However , the tip of the urinary tract ( urethra ) plays a huge role in modifying the shape of the jet .<>When you go to the bathroom and pee, the urine is stored in a part of your body called the bladder. When you're ready to pee, your bladder muscles contract and push the urine out through a tube called the urethra. The shape of the urethra and the surrounding muscles can help to control the flow of urine, and can cause it to come out in a straight line.\r\n\r\nFluid dynamics is a branch of physics that studies how fluids (liquids and gases) behave and interact with objects. Fluids can flow in different ways depending on their properties and the shape of the container they are in. In the case of peeing, the fluid is urine and the container is the urethra. The shape of the urethra and the surrounding muscles can help to control the flow of urine, and can cause it to come out in a straight line.<>reddit_eli5
