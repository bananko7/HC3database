Torque in relation to a car 's performance ? I 've heard its something to do with rotatational force etc . but what does that actully mean . Is is the feeling of ' got some poke ' when you accelerate in a decent car ? Explain like I'm five.<>ELI5 : Torque : acceleration Horsepower : Top speed . For older than 5 , It 's a bit more complicated than that , there 's a \" torque curve \" meaning how much torque you have at any given RPM . If you have torque at low RPM , you can feel the push coming off of a redlight . If you have good torque at high RPM , you can get a push once you 're already moving , good for passing on a highway . If you have a \" fat torque curve \" you have good torque at both low and high RPM , a good car for driving on curvy roads .<>\\nTorque is a measure of the rotational force or \"twisting\" power that an engine produces. It is often described as the feeling of \"acceleration\" or \"poke\" that you get when you press down on the gas pedal of a car. The more torque an engine produces, the more force it can apply to the wheels of the car, which can make the car feel faster and more powerful when you accelerate.\\n\\nThink of torque like a person turning a bolt with a wrench. The harder they turn the wrench, the more torque they are applying. In a car, the engine produces torque, which is then transmitted to the wheels through the transmission and drivetrain. The wheels then use this torque to move the car forward.\\n\\nIn general, engines that produce a lot of torque tend to be more powerful and able to accelerate the car more quickly. This is why torque is an important factor to consider when evaluating the performance of a car. However, torque is not the only factor that affects a car's performance. Other factors, such as the car's weight, aerodynamics, and the efficiency of the transmission and drivetrain, can also affect how the car performs.<>reddit_eli5
