Why do we need to go to Mars ? There are numerous experiments \/ projects \/ studies happening as we speak or in the planning stages and these are to estimate , study , or predict what it takes to get to and survive on Mars . Why ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Because having every human being in existence living on one easily destroyed rock is incredibly short sighted . We need to start moving off of earth if we want to survive and evolve as a species . Plus it would be indescribably awesome to know that a member of my species is standing on another planet more than 33 million miles away . It just boggles my mind that a little more than a century ago humans were mostly stuck in the ground , and now we 're capable of colonizing a completely new world .<>There are several reasons why people are interested in going to Mars. One reason is scientific curiosity. Scientists want to learn more about Mars and see if it is possible for humans to live there. They are also interested in finding out if there is or was life on Mars. Another reason is that Mars is a possible backup plan for humanity. If something were to happen to Earth, like a catastrophic event, it would be good to have another place where people could live. Mars is one of the most promising places in our solar system for this because it has a lot of resources, like water and a thin atmosphere. Finally, going to Mars is also an engineering challenge. It takes a lot of technology and planning to get people and equipment to Mars and keep them alive once they are there. By working on this challenge, we can learn more about how to explore space and develop new technologies that can be used for other purposes here on Earth.<>reddit_eli5
