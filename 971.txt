[ Math ] Can any of you explain Logarithms with detail from scratch ? Make sure to explain ln and e because that is what I do n't understand one bit . Explain like I'm five.<>Logarithms are basically [ what you get when you count with multiplication rather than adding ] ( URL_0 ) .<>Sure! I'd be happy to help explain logarithms to you.\r\n\r\nA logarithm is a way of expressing how many times you need to multiply a number by itself to get a certain result. For example, the logarithm of 8 (written as log(8)) to base 2 is 3, because 2 x 2 x 2 = 8. We can write this as:\r\n\r\nlog(8) = 3\r\n\r\nIn this case, the base of the logarithm is 2.\r\n\r\nThe natural logarithm, written as ln(x), is the logarithm to base e, where e is a special number that is approximately equal to 2.71828. This number, e, is sometimes called the \"exponential constant\" because it appears in many mathematical equations that involve exponential growth.\r\n\r\nFor example, the natural logarithm of 8 (written as ln(8)) is approximately 2.07944. We can write this as:\r\n\r\nln(8) = 2.07944\r\n\r\nI hope this helps! Do you have any questions about what I explained, or is there anything else you would like to know?<>reddit_eli5
