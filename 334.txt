If a company goes private, does it still count as a capital gain\/loss?<>does it still count as a capital gain or loss? Yes. Is it essentially treated like you sold the stock at the price of the buy-out?  Yes. Do you still get a 1099-B from your broker? Yes.<>Yes, if you sell your shares in a company that goes private, you may realize a capital gain or loss on the sale. A capital gain is the difference between the sale price of an asset and your cost basis, which is the original price you paid for the asset. If you sell the asset for more than your cost basis, you have a capital gain. If you sell the asset for less than your cost basis, you have a capital loss.Whether a company is public or private does not change the tax treatment of any capital gains or losses you may realize on the sale of the company's shares. However, the process for selling shares in a private company may be different from the process for selling shares in a public company. It may be more difficult to find a buyer for your shares in a private company, and the sale may take longer to complete.It's important to keep in mind that capital gains and losses may be taxed differently depending on how long you held the asset and your tax filing status. You should consult a tax professional or refer to the IRS guidelines for more information on how capital gains and losses are taxed.<>finance
