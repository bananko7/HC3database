What happens to someone in a wheelchair when they go to prison ? I ca n't imagine many prisons are wheelchair accessible , and I 've been wondering for ages what happens . Edit : Apparently prisons * * are * * wheelchair accessible Please explain like I'm five.<>They live in a unit on the ground floor . Other inmates help push them places , or help them up steps if needed . But they 're pretty wheelchair accessible , with only additional living space ( cells ) in upper levels . I 've rarely seen steps into buildings . Every place inmates go is concrete and even if it 's on a hill , there 's a walkway , not steps .

This means that prisons must have ramps, elevators, and other accommodations to make it easier for people in wheelchairs to move around the facility. \nIf someone in a wheelchair is sentenced to prison, they will be placed in a unit or cell that is accessible to them. This may include having a wheelchair-accessible shower, toilet, and bed. The prison may also have staff members who are trained to assist people with disabilities, including those who use wheelchairs. \nIt is important to note that every prison is different, and some may have more or less accessibility than others. However, overall, the goal is to ensure that people with disabilities, including those who use wheelchairs, are able to access the same services and opportunities as everyone else while they are in prison.<>reddit_eli5
