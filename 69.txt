What would someone with a chromosome combination of YY look like ? I know it 's impossible , but what if ? Explain like I'm five.<>Since the X chromosome contains thousands of genes , while the Y contains only dozens , I 'm gon na say they 'd look dead .<>It is not possible for a person to have a chromosome combination of YY because the Y chromosome is found only in males and is not present in females. Normally, humans have 46 chromosomes in each of their cells, which are organized into 23 pairs. One of these pairs is the sex chromosomes, which are called X and Y. Males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome (XY), while females have two X chromosomes (XX).\r\n\r\nThe presence of the Y chromosome determines whether a person develops as a male or female. During fetal development, the presence of the Y chromosome causes the development of male reproductive organs, such as the testes. The absence of the Y chromosome results in the development of female reproductive organs, such as the ovaries.\r\n\r\nIf a person were to have a chromosome combination of YY, it would mean that they have two Y chromosomes instead of one. This is not possible because the Y chromosome does not have the ability to produce another Y chromosome. Therefore, it is not possible for a person to have a chromosome combination of YY.<>It is not possible for a person to have a chromosome combination of YY because the Y chromosome is found only in males and is not present in females.
