Why do clothing stores generally have a ton of XL and XXL sizes in stock but only a few S and M sized items left ? Would n't supply and demand have corrected this problem by now ? amirite people ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Your observation is almost certainly a matter of perceptual bias . If you 're only looking for small size clothing , it 's frustrating when you ca n't find it and everything is X \/ XL instead . However , when you 're looking for clothing and you do find the right size you generally do n't remember how much X \/ XL was always there . As a result , virtually everyone will have the same experience of \" there 's never anything in my size ! \" even though everyone is not the same size .<>There are a few reasons why clothing stores may have more XL and XXL sizes in stock compared to smaller sizes. One reason is that larger sizes may be more popular in certain areas or among certain demographics. For example, if a store is located in a region where people tend to be larger in size, they may sell more larger sizes. Similarly, if a store caters to a particular demographic that tends to be larger in size, they may also sell more larger sizes. Another reason is that it can be more expensive to produce smaller sizes. Clothing manufacturers often have to use more fabric and pay more attention to detail when making smaller sizes, which can increase the cost of production. As a result, stores may order fewer smaller sizes to save on costs. Finally, it's important to note that clothing stores often order their inventory based on past sales data. If a store has consistently sold more larger sizes in the past, they may order more of those sizes in the future. On the other hand, if they have consistently sold fewer smaller sizes, they may order fewer of those sizes. Overall, the balance of sizes in a store's inventory is influenced by a combination of factors, including consumer demand, production costs, and past sales data.<>reddit_eli5
