There are a few different things that people can do to camouflage a ship:\\n\\nPainting the ship: One way to camouflage a ship is by painting it a color that matches the surrounding environment. For example, if the ship is sailing in an area with a lot of blue water and sky, it might be painted a blue color to try and blend in with the water and sky.\\n\\nAdding netting or other materials: Another way to camouflage a ship is by attaching netting or other materials to the outside of the ship. These materials can help to break up the outline of the ship and make it harder to see.\\n\\nUsing specialized paint: Some navies use specialized paint that can help to make a ship harder to see on radar. This paint absorbs radar waves instead of reflecting them, so the ship is less visible to radar systems.\\n\\nOverall, the goal of camouflage on ships is to make it harder for the enemy to spot the ship, which can help to protect the ship and its crew during times of war or conflict.<>reddit_eli5
