Edit : thanks for the answers . Please explain like I'm five.<>I can do that , its 3 letters and 3 numbers in my country do nt see how that can be hard .<>In real life, it is possible for people, including police officers, to quickly memorize a license plate number under stressful circumstances. This is because the human brain is capable of rapidly processing and committing important information to memory when it is necessary. \nOne way that police officers might be able to quickly memorize a license plate number is by using a technique called \"chunking.\" This involves breaking the long string of numbers and letters on the license plate into smaller, more manageable chunks that are easier to remember. For example, a license plate number might be broken up into three chunks: ABC-123, XYZ-456, or something similar. By breaking the information into chunks, the brain can more easily process and retain it. \nAnother way that police officers might be able to quickly memorize a license plate number is by using visual imagery. For example, they might associate the numbers and letters on the license plate with familiar objects or images. This can help make the information more memorable and easier to recall. \nOverall, being able to quickly memorize a license plate number under stressful circumstances is a skill that can be developed through training and practice. It is not necessarily something that comes naturally to everyone, but it is a useful ability for police officers and other professionals to have.<>reddit_eli5
