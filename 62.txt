What do you learn during an engineering degree ? What exactly do you learn during an engineering degree and why is it considered such a difficult field ? Explain like I'm five.
I am a chemical engineer . My degree included things such as : * The fundamental science behind the way energy and mass move around : heat transfer , diffusion , fluid flow , solubility * Rates of reaction , what they mean and what affects them * How to use this understanding to design ways to mix , react and separate all kinds of different substances * The mathematics needed to describe the way these systems behave and solve those equations to predict what will happen * Numerical methods for solving the more complex sets of equations , and how to use computer programs to do this * Specific applications of all the above , e.g. very common applications such as distillation , or new and unusual ones such as microprocess engineering * Some basics of economics , including how to cost a plant and calculate returns on investment * Safety in design and operation of your plant * A bit of business and management knowledge A lot of these topics require a very good understanding of the other topics listed to be able to learn them , and engineers need to apply the fundamental principles and tools to many different situations so that they can generalise and know how to investigate the unique situations they will encounter in industry .
During an engineering degree, students learn how to design and build things that solve problems. This might include designing a bridge that can support a lot of weight without breaking, creating a new type of computer program, or building a machine that can make a product more efficiently.\r\n\r\nEngineering is considered a difficult field because it requires a lot of math and science knowledge, as well as the ability to think critically and solve problems. Engineers also need to be able to work in teams and communicate their ideas effectively. These skills take time and practice to develop, which is why earning an engineering degree often takes longer than other types of degrees.
