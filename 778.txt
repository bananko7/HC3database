Why did the dozen become popular ? Why did the value of dozen become popular ? Why not 14 ? Or 10 ? I presume it goes back to bread - baking since a lot of \" dozens \" have to do with baking . Please explain like I'm five.<>You can split it up in a variety of way for even distribution . 2 people can have 6 each 3 people can have 4 each 4 people can have 3 each 5 people can have 2 each and me and you split the extras . 6 people can have 2 each .<>The use of the word \"dozen\" to refer to a group of 12 items has been traced back to the Middle Ages. It likely became popular because 12 is a convenient number to work with. It can be evenly divided by 2, 3, 4, and 6, which made it useful for many different types of calculations.The concept of a dozen may have been especially useful in baking because bakers often need to measure ingredients in precise quantities, and 12 is a number that is easy to divide into smaller amounts. For example, you can evenly divide a dozen eggs into 4 groups of 3, or 2 groups of 6.While it is possible to use other numbers, such as 14 or 10, to refer to a group of items, the number 12 has become especially associated with the word \"dozen\" and is the most commonly used number in this context.<>reddit_eli5
