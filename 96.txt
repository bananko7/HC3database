Credit balance on new credit card<>A Credit Balance means that you overpayed. That's nothing to worry about; it will just be used up by your next charges. Note that this can have two reasons - either you really paid too much; or you paid off a charge that is still 'pending' - meaning it has not yet posted and is not considered in the amount you owe: Most charges in restaurants for example are pending for a day or more, because the original charge is your bill without tip (they don't know the tip when the run the card!), and the merchant spends his weekends or evenings to type in the final amount (including tip) and post the pending charge. If this is the case, it will settle ('get posted') in a day or two, and then it will match up.<>A credit balance on a new credit card refers to the amount of credit that is available to you on the card. This is the maximum amount of money that you can charge to the card before you reach your credit limit. Your credit limit is set by the credit card issuer based on your credit history and financial situation.When you first receive a new credit card, your credit balance will typically be equal to your credit limit. As you use the card to make purchases, the credit balance will decrease. If you make a payment on the card, the credit balance will increase.It is important to keep track of your credit balance and to try to avoid exceeding your credit limit. If you exceed your credit limit, you may be charged an over-limit fee, and this can have a negative impact on your credit score.To find out your credit balance on a new credit card, you can check your credit card statement or log in to your account online or through the credit card issuer's mobile app. You can also call the credit card issuer and ask for your current credit balance.<>A credit balance on a new credit card refers to the amount of credit that is available to you on the card.
