What is Ethos , Logos , and Pathos ? I just ca n't interpret the meaning of these three ideas . Explain like I'm five. <>Ethos - Ethics . Knowing right from wrong . Logos - Logic . Knowing what can be proven and is factual . Pathos - Emotions . Knowing how someone feels about something .<>Ethos, logos, and pathos are three modes of persuasion that can be used to convince an audience to believe a particular point of view.\\n\\nEthos refers to the credibility or trustworthiness of the speaker. It's about whether the audience believes the speaker is knowledgeable and trustworthy. For example, if a doctor gives a presentation about a new medical treatment, the audience is more likely to trust the information if the doctor has a lot of experience and expertise in the field.\\n\\nLogos refers to the use of logical arguments and evidence to support a claim. It's about using reason and evidence to convince the audience that something is true. For example, if someone is trying to convince you that climate change is real, they might use logos by presenting data and scientific evidence that shows the Earth's temperature is rising and that this is caused by human activity.\\n\\nPathos refers to the use of emotions to persuade an audience. It's about trying to appeal to the audience's feelings and emotions in order to convince them. For example, if a politician wants to convince people to vote for them, they might use pathos by telling a story about a family in need and how their policies will help people like that family.\\n\\nSo, in summary, ethos is about trustworthiness, logos is about using logic and evidence, and pathos is about using emotions to persuade.<>reddit_eli5
