Why do some TV shows take random month \/ two week long breaks right in the middle of a season ? It 's the worst Explain like I'm five.<>Honestly , tv shows used to only take a break during the major holidays as people would likely be traveling and spending time with family rather than watch tv . Season would last almost 25 episodes but not as much now . Recently there has been a trend of only ordering \" pilot \" seasons . These are only 6 episode commitments ( i.e. walking dead \" season 1 \" ) so that the channel does nt have to commit to a whole season if the show tanks or gets bad reviews , they can drop the show at any time and reduce the risk since ALOT of shows now get flat out dropped if they do poorly . With the advent of Pilot seasons , most shows are split up now under this premise ... it costs the channel much less now to drop if need be and as others mentioned , build anticipation ( re : frustration ) .<>TV shows often take breaks in the middle of a season for a few different reasons. One reason is that it can be very expensive to produce a TV show, and taking breaks can help the producers spread out the cost over a longer period of time. Another reason is that TV networks often want to air their shows at certain times of the year, and taking breaks can help them schedule the show in a way that makes sense for their programming schedule. Finally, taking breaks can also allow the writers, actors, and crew of the show to take a break and recharge before continuing to work on the rest of the season.<>reddit_eli5
