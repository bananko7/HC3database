Why do we perceive the Earth 's rotation so slow ? If the Earth spins at 1,040 mph , how come we do n't really feel like it 's doing it so fast . Explain like I'm five. <>You do n't ever feel velocity . You feel acceleration . When a car is stopped at a red light and the light turns green , you feel the car accelerate to a higher speed . But if you stay at a constant speed you do n't feel any force , because there is no force . The famous equation is F = ma . F being force , m being mass , and a be acceleration . With no acceleration there is no force . Since the Earth is spinning at a very constant rate there is no acceleration so there is no force for you to feel .<>The Earth spins on its axis very fast, but because the Earth is so big, it takes a long time for the spin to cause any noticeable effects. It's like if you are on a carousel (a roundabout) at the fair. Even though the carousel is spinning very fast, you don't feel like you are moving very fast because you are moving with the carousel. It's only when you try to walk around the outside of the carousel that you feel like you are moving faster because you are not moving with the spin of the carousel. The same is true for the Earth. We are moving with the Earth's spin, so we don't feel like we are moving very fast.<>reddit_eli5
