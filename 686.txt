Purpose of a disease I know that it wants to surivive by multiplying in the body but if it eventually kills the host , does nt it die as well ? Please explain like I'm five.<>> but if it eventually kills the host , does nt it die as well ? Diseases do n't * want * to kill the host . They simply ' want ' to ( or more precisely , have evolved to effectively ) reproduce , as you point out . Killing the host is an unintended consequence . This can be good or bad for the disease causing agent itself , if it can be spread by the corpse being eaten , for instance , or if it is so lethal that it tends to wipe out a population faster than it can spread ( as ebola has done in the past ) . Many diseases do n't kill their hosts , and this also tends to present advantages , such as enabling it to be spread more thoroughly and keeping its ' food supply ' alive .<>Sure! A disease is a condition that causes harm to the body. It can be caused by different things, like bacteria, viruses, or other germs. These germs can multiply and spread in the body, and they can cause problems with how the body works.Sometimes, a disease can make a person very sick and even kill them. But even if the disease kills the person, the germs that caused the disease can still survive. They can spread to other people and cause the same disease in them.So even though the disease may have killed the first person, it can still keep going by infecting other people. It's like a game of survival for the germs - they want to keep multiplying and spreading, even if it means the person they are inside of gets sick or dies.<>reddit_eli5
