Why do I have to \" gulp \" liquids ? Would n't my throat just be able to stay \" open \" and let it flow down ? Foods I can understand needing help , but liquid seems like a straightforward thing . Please explain like I'm five.<>Your throat is used for both swallowing and for breathing . At one point the path diverges to the esophagus and trachea , which go to your stomach and lungs , respectively . There 's a valve at that point — the epiglottis — which normally stays in \" breathing \" mode . When you swallow it temporarily switches to \" eating \" mode . Gulping is the action that switches between these two modes .<>When you drink liquids, your throat naturally narrows slightly to help prevent liquids from going down the wrong pipe and entering your airway. This narrowing is controlled by muscles in your throat, and it happens automatically when you swallow. \nIf you try to drink too much liquid too quickly, it can be difficult for the muscles in your throat to keep up with the flow of liquid. As a result, some of the liquid may end up going down the wrong pipe and entering your airway, which can cause coughing and choking. \nGulping liquids can help prevent this from happening by allowing you to take smaller sips of liquid that are easier for your throat muscles to control. This can make it easier to swallow the liquid without coughing or choking. \nSo, while it is possible to just let liquids flow down your throat without gulping, it is generally a good idea to take smaller sips and gulp them to make it easier to swallow and prevent coughing and choking.<>reddit_eli5
