Are there “buy and hold” passively managed funds?<>They pretty much already have what you are looking for.  They are called Unit Investment Trusts.  The key behind these is (a)  the trust starts out with a fixed pool of securities.  It is completely unmanaged and there is no buying or selling of the securities, (b) they terminate after a fixed period of time, at which time all assets are distributed among the owners. According to Investment Company Institute, \"securities in a UIT are   professionally selected to meet a stated investment objective,  such   as growth,  income, or capital appreciation.\" UITs sell a fixed    number of units at one-time  public offering. Securities in a UIT do    not trade actively, rather, UITs use a  strategy known as    buy-and-hold. The UIT purchases a certain amount of  securities and    holds them until its termination date. Holdings rarely change   throughout the life of the trust so unit holders know exactly what    they're  investing in, and the trust lists all securities in its    prospectus. Unit trusts  normally sell redeemable units - this    obligates the trust to re-purchase  investor's units at their net    asset value at the investors request.<>Yes, there are passively managed funds that follow a \"buy and hold\" strategy. Passive funds, also known as index funds, aim to track the performance of a specific market index by holding a portfolio of securities that represents the index. The goal of these funds is to replicate the performance of the underlying index as closely as possible, rather than outperforming it through active management. As a result, they generally have lower expense ratios and fewer portfolio turnover than actively managed funds.Passively managed funds that follow a \"buy and hold\" strategy typically have a long-term investment horizon and do not frequently buy and sell securities in an effort to time the market. Instead, they seek to provide a low-cost and diversified way for investors to gain exposure to a particular market or asset class.It's worth noting that all investments carry some level of risk and it's important for investors to carefully consider their financial goals and risk tolerance before making any investment decisions.<>finance
