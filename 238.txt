Where should I park my rainy-day \/ emergency fund?<>Something with an FDIC guarentee, so a bank. With an emergency fund, I think the 'return of capital' is more important than the 'return on the capital', so I'm fine with putting it in a standard savings account in a local bank(not an internet account) even if it pays next to nothing. The beauty is that since the bank is local, you can walk in and withdraw it all during any weekday.<>It is generally recommended to keep your rainy-day or emergency fund in a safe and easily accessible place, such as a savings account or a short-term certificate of deposit (CD) at a bank or credit union. These types of accounts typically offer relatively low returns but also have little to no risk of losing your principal investment.Keep in mind that the primary purpose of an emergency fund is to provide a financial cushion in case of unexpected expenses or income disruptions, such as a job loss or medical emergency. As a result, it is important to prioritize safety and accessibility over potential returns when choosing where to park your emergency fund.Here are a few things to consider when selecting a place to keep your emergency fund:Safety: Look for accounts that are FDIC-insured or backed by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) to protect your money in the event that the institution goes out of business.Accessibility: Choose an account that allows you to easily withdraw your money when you need it, such as a savings account or short-term CD. Avoid investing your emergency fund in longer-term investments, such as stocks or mutual funds, as these may not be easily accessible in the event of an emergency.Fees: Look for accounts with low or no fees to maximize the returns on your emergency fund.Interest rates: While the primary purpose of an emergency fund is not to earn a high return, it is still a good idea to shop around and compare rates at different financial institutions to ensure you are getting the best return possible. Just keep in mind that the interest rate should not be the main factor in your decision, as the main goal is to keep your money safe and accessible.<>finance
