why does a \" normal \" guitar have 6 stings but a bass guitar has 4 As someone learning to play the \" normal \" guitar , I was a little curious Please explain like I'm five.<>The bass guitar is a replacement for the upright double bass - the one that looks like a really big cello . That , like the rest of the orchestra string instruments , has 4 strings , so the electric bass kept that arrangement .<>Sure! A \"normal\" guitar has 6 strings because it is designed to play a wide range of notes and chords. The strings are tuned to different pitches, and by strumming or picking the strings, a musician can play a variety of melodies and harmonies.A bass guitar also has strings that are tuned to different pitches, but it has fewer strings because the strings are generally thicker and longer than those on a regular guitar. This allows the bass guitar to produce lower-pitched notes, which are an important part of the rhythm section in most types of music. Bass guitarists use their instrument to play the root note of a chord, which helps to anchor the harmony and establish the groove of a song.So in short, a \"normal\" guitar has 6 strings to allow for a wide range of notes and a bass guitar has fewer, thicker strings to produce lower-pitched notes.<>reddit_eli5
