What causes mid-back pain radiating towards the ribs while having spinal stenosis?I have pain to the right of my mid back which feels like someone punched me in the back. It is worsened with standing or sitting upright and improves if I slouch in a chair. The pain is now radiating to my right ribs. I have had this for 6 months and the radiation is new. I have severe degenerative spine disease with spinal stenosis in my lumbar and cervical spine. Any suggestions?<>Hi,I am Dr Gopal Goel Orthopedic Surgeon. Your pain seems as if one of the nerves in dorsal spine is being pressed.  I suggest MRI of Dorsal spine , Pain killers , Pregabalin . If pain does not improve in few days time , I suggest you consult a pain specialist who may use nerve block to relieve pain.<>Mid-back pain that radiates towards the ribs can have a variety of causes, and in your case, it is likely related to your degenerative spine disease and spinal stenosis.\n\nSpinal stenosis is a condition in which the spinal canal narrows, placing pressure on the nerves that travel through it. This can cause pain, numbness, and weakness in the affected area. In your case, the pain may be radiating to your ribs because the affected nerve roots or spinal cord are located in the mid-back region and are being compressed by the narrowing of the spinal canal.\n\nSome other potential causes of mid-back pain include muscle strain, herniated discs, and spinal fractures. It is important to see a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. They will be able to assess your specific situation and recommend the best course of action. This may include medications to manage the pain, physical therapy to strengthen the muscles supporting the spine, and possibly surgery to decompress the nerves or stabilize the spine.\n\nIt is also important to practice good posture and engage in regular exercise to help maintain the health and strength of your spine. Avoiding activities that put excessive strain on your back, such as lifting heavy objects, can also help to prevent further pain and injury.<>medicine
