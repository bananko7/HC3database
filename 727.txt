How does \" fracking \" cause earthquakes ? I keep seeing in the news of earthquakes blames on fracking , especially in Oklahoma . Is this cause \/ effect proven , is it a theory , and how does it happen ? Please explain like I'm five.<>It does n't , I 'm a petroleum engineer and I can assure you that fracking wo n't cause any earthquakes . It can cause other things , like when you do it on a gas reservoir some gas may leak if not done right , but no eartquakes .<>Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is a process used to extract oil and natural gas from shale rock formations. It involves injecting a mixture of water, sand, and chemicals into the ground at high pressure to create small fractures, or cracks, in the rock. This allows oil and gas to flow more easily out of the rock and into the well. While fracking has been successful in increasing the supply of oil and natural gas, it has also been linked to an increase in earthquakes in some areas. These earthquakes are usually small and do not pose a significant risk to people, but they can be felt by people living nearby. The cause of these earthquakes is not fully understood, but it is thought that the injection of water and other fluids into the ground during fracking can cause the ground to shift and move, leading to earthquakes. Some scientists believe that these earthquakes may also be related to the disposal of waste water from the fracking process, which is often injected back into the ground. Overall, the relationship between fracking and earthquakes is still being studied, and more research is needed to understand the full extent of this connection.<>reddit_eli5
