The pros for marijuana legalization I 've seen stuff here and there on reddit about weed legalization , but I still do n't have a very clear picture on what the concrete supporting facts are . Please explain like I'm five.<>In one sense , the most powerful pro for marijuana legalization is that it restores a personal freedom that the government does nâ€™t really have a reasonable basis for denying .<>Sure! Here are a few reasons why some people think marijuana should be legal: 1. It is less harmful than alcohol and tobacco. Some studies have shown that marijuana is less addictive and has fewer negative health effects than alcohol or tobacco. 2. It could be a good source of tax revenue. If marijuana were legal, the government could tax it and use the money to fund public services like education or healthcare. 3. It could help people with medical conditions. Some people use marijuana to manage symptoms of certain medical conditions, such as chronic pain or epilepsy. Legalizing marijuana would make it easier for these people to get the treatment they need. 4. It could reduce crime. If marijuana were legal, people wouldn't have to buy it from illegal drug dealers, which could reduce crime rates. 5. It could lead to more research. Because marijuana is currently illegal, there is very little research on its potential benefits or risks. Legalizing marijuana would allow researchers to study it more and learn more about its effects.<>reddit_eli5
