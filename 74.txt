What legal action can Paypal take against me if I don't pay them and I have a negative balance?<>Paypal can take exactly the same legal actions against you as any creditor could -- take you to court for wilful nonpayment of debt, sell your debt to a collections agency, or anything else a business would do with a deadbeat customer. But this is a legal question, and as such off topic here.<>If you have a negative balance with PayPal and you don't pay it, PayPal may take a number of legal actions to try to recover the funds. These actions may include:Filing a lawsuit against you: PayPal may file a lawsuit in a court of law to try to recover the funds that you owe.Garnishing your wages: If PayPal obtains a judgment against you in court, it may be able to garnish your wages, which means that a portion of your salary will be withheld and paid directly to PayPal to pay off your debt.Placing a lien on your property: PayPal may be able to place a lien on your property, which means that it has the right to seize and sell your property in order to recover the funds that you owe.Reporting the debt to credit agencies: PayPal may report your debt to credit agencies, which could have a negative impact on your credit score.It's important to note that the specific legal actions that PayPal can take will depend on the laws of your jurisdiction and the terms of your account with PayPal. If you are concerned about your negative balance with PayPal, it's a good idea to contact PayPal and try to work out a payment plan or other arrangement to pay off the debt.<>finance
