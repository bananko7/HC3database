Why do persons in the military wear their uniform outside of work ? I honestly love the military and for their service , I just wonder why I see them in their uniform almost all day . Thanks ! Explain like I'm five.<>In my case , only time I wore my uniform outside of work was for quick tasks on the way to or from work such as stopping for gas , grocery , food , etc . With that , if you spot a guy in uniform at a bar or a club(which I 've personally witnessed ) chances are he 's most likely an asshole milking the uniform .<>Many people in the military wear their uniforms outside of work because it is a part of their job. They are required to wear their uniform at certain times, such as when they are performing their duties or when they are representing their branch of the military. Wearing the uniform helps to show that they are part of a team and are proud of the work they do. It is also a way to show respect for the military and the country they serve.<>reddit_eli5
