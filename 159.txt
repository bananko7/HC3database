Does 0 calories always mean no weight gain ? Suppose someone drank 4 litres of diet coke every day for a couple weeks ( and nothing else ) , would that mean that they actually lost weight ? Please explain like I'm five.<>You mean they did n't eat any food ? Yes , they would lose weight , but they would also be starving themselves and getting no nutrients whatsoever .<>Calories are a unit of energy that our bodies use to function and to do things like move around and think. When we eat and drink, we get calories from the food and drinks that we have. When we have more calories than our bodies need, our bodies can store the extra calories as fat, and this can cause us to gain weight.If someone drinks 4 liters of diet coke every day, and each liter has 0 calories, then they are not getting any extra calories from the diet coke. This means that their body will not have any extra calories to store as fat, and so they should not gain weight.However, it is not a good idea to drink only diet coke and nothing else for a long time. Our bodies need a variety of nutrients from different types of food in order to be healthy. Drinking only diet coke, or any other single food or drink, will not provide all of the nutrients that our bodies need to function properly.<>reddit_eli5
