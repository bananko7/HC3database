Why do movies always show people suffocating others with pillows ? I 've put a pillow over my face , and I can breathe normally . Does it ever work ? If not , where did the myth come from ? Please explain like I'm five.<>There 's a very significant difference between trying to suffocate * yourself * and someone else trying to suffocate you . Your arm muscles need oxygen to push hard enough to suffocate someone , so you just can not do it with a pillow . Your arms give out long before you 're in any sort of danger . A large part of the reason people die when smothered is that they freak out and hyperventilate , which wastes their oxygen reserves . You can not self - simulate that sort of panic without the help of a belt around your neck , which I do not recommend unless you want to have a really strong and awesome orgasm .<>Movies often show people suffocating others with pillows as a way to depict a murder or attempted murder because it is a relatively quick and quiet way to kill someone. However, in real life, suffocating someone with a pillow is generally not effective because the person being suffocated can still breathe through their nose and mouth, even if the pillow is covering their face. The idea that suffocating someone with a pillow could be an easy and effective way to kill someone probably comes from the fact that pillows are soft and comfortable, and it may seem like they would be a gentle way to cause someone to fall asleep. However, in reality, suffocating someone with a pillow is not a reliable or effective way to kill someone, and it is not something that should be attempted in any situation.<>reddit_eli5
