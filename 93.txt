Why is mold acceptable in some foods , such as cheese , but not in anything else ? We 're able to enjoy something like blue cheese dressing , but once mold shows up on bread , it 's no good . Why is that ? Thanks ! Explain like I'm five. <>Some molds create toxins that are harmful to the human body . The molds that cause many types of cheese ( such as the blue cheese dressing you enjoy ) do not create the harmful toxins . Mold on many other foods do n't necessarily indicate danger just a lack of freshness ( fermentation happening , change in taste , texture , etc . ) and are perfectly safe to eat but if you have other food options you will likely throw it away because you probably have enough money to not eat moldy bread .<>Mold is a type of fungus that can grow on a variety of different foods, including cheese and bread.
