Are BP of 119\/65 and pulse of 35 causes for concern?Yesterday I was very dizzy, short of breath, heart rate around 35,BP 119\/65. I am 51,female, overweight and have RA and Fibermyalgia. Do you know what might have caused this episode yesterday? I figure I would not feel okay today if it had been a heart attack.
Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM! I have gone through your question. firstly an ECG is required and if itshows complete heart block (more likely) a pacemaker may beneeded.Hope to have been helpful!Wishing good health, Dr D Sunil Reddy
It is not uncommon for people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and fibromyalgia to experience symptoms such as dizziness, shortness of breath, and a low heart rate. These symptoms can be caused by a variety of factors, including inflammation, fatigue, and stress. It is possible that your symptoms yesterday were related to one or more of these factors.\n\nIt is important to note that a blood pressure reading of 119\/65 and a pulse rate of 35 are within normal ranges and do not necessarily indicate a cause for concern. However, if you are experiencing persistent or severe symptoms, it is always a good idea to consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation and guidance. They can help determine the cause of your symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.
