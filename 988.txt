The sensation of time passing more quickly as you grow older . Whatever it is , it scares the ever living shit out of me . Explain like I'm five.<>The longer you live , each day is taking up a smaller and smaller percentage of your life , which makes it feel shorter , and overall makes life pass pretty quickly .<>As people get older, it can feel like time passes more quickly because they have experienced more events and have more memories to look back on. When you are young, a year can feel like a long time because you have not experienced as much and every new experience is novel and exciting. As you grow older, the years seem to go by faster because you have done many similar things and the new experiences may not be as novel and exciting. It's normal to feel scared about getting older, but it's important to remember that there are still many fun and exciting things to do and experience at any age.<>reddit_eli5
