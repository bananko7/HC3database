Why can dishwashers both wash and dry dishes , but clothes washers can not wash and dry clothes ? Seriously . Explain like I'm five.<>Because clothes ca n't be tried as easily by just making them super hot like a dishwasher does . Since dishes do n't absorb water , and they also do n't burn . Dual machines for clothes can and do exist , but they 're more expensive , and more prone to failure . Since the two jobs are really quite different ( and plenty of clothes can be machine washed but not machine tried ) it just makes more sense to buy them separate .<>Dishwashers and clothes washers are designed to do different things. Dishwashers are specifically made to wash and dry dishes, while clothes washers are made to wash clothes.\n\nOne reason why dishwashers can both wash and dry dishes is because they use hot water and detergent to clean the dishes, and then use heat and air circulation to dry the dishes. This process is effective for washing and drying dishes because dishes are typically made of materials that can withstand high temperatures and are not easily damaged by heat.\n\nOn the other hand, clothes washers are not designed to dry clothes because clothes are made of more delicate materials that can be damaged by heat and high temperatures. Instead, clothes washers are designed to use water and detergent to clean clothes, and then spin the clothes to remove excess water. After the clothes are washed, they need to be dried using a separate appliance, such as a dryer, that uses heat and air circulation to remove moisture from the clothes.\n\nSo, dishwashers and clothes washers are designed to do different things because the materials they are designed to clean require different washing and drying methods.<>reddit_eli5
