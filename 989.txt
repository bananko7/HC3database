Please explain what is \"Credit rating\"<>A credit rating is an evaluation of the credit risk of a prospective debtor (an individual, a business, company or a government), predicting their ability to pay back the debt, and  an implicit forecast of the likelihood of the debtor defaulting.\nThe credit rating represents an evaluation of a credit rating agency of the qualitative and quantitative information for the prospective debtor, including information provided by the prospective debtor and other non-public information obtained by the credit rating agency's analysts.\nCredit reporting (or  credit score) – is a subset of credit rating – it is a numeric evaluation of an individual's credit worthiness, which is done by a credit bureau or consumer credit reporting agency.<>A credit rating is an assessment of the creditworthiness of an individual, corporation, or government, indicating their ability to pay back debt. Credit ratings are typically assigned by credit rating agencies, which are independent companies that evaluate the credit risk of borrowers.\n\n\n\nCredit ratings are important because they help lenders, investors, and others assess the risk associated with lending money or investing in a particular borrower. A higher credit rating typically indicates a lower risk of default, meaning that the borrower is more likely to be able to pay back their debt on time. A lower credit rating, on the other hand, indicates a higher risk of default, meaning that the borrower may be less likely to pay back their debt on time.\n\n\n\nCredit ratings are typically expressed as a letter or series of letters, with \"AAA\" being the highest rating and \"D\" being the lowest. The specific rating system used may vary depending on the credit rating agency and the type of borrower being rated.\n\n\n\nIt's worth noting that credit ratings are not static and can change over time. A borrower's credit rating may improve if they are able to demonstrate a strong track record of paying back debt, or it may deteriorate if they have difficulty making payments or experience other financial problems.<>wiki_csai
