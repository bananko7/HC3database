How did 40 % ABV become the standard strength of mass - produced hard liquor ? Is there a legal or traditional reason for this very common number ? Please explain like I'm five.<>It is not the standard everywhere . For instance in Europe the 40 % batches were common , so they put a tax on 35 % and higher liquors . Now here they sell 33 % liquors .<>The standard strength of mass-produced hard liquor is 40% ABV, or alcohol by volume, because this concentration is a good balance between the taste and potency of the alcohol. \nThere is no legal requirement for hard liquor to be 40% ABV, but many distilleries and breweries have settled on this concentration because it is a good compromise between the strength of the alcohol and the flavor of the drink. \nIn general, the higher the ABV, the stronger the flavor and the more potent the drink. Some people prefer stronger flavors and higher potencies, while others prefer a more mild flavor and lower potency. By producing hard liquor at 40% ABV, distilleries and breweries can appeal to a wide range of consumers who have different preferences. \nSo, while there is no specific legal or traditional reason for hard liquor to be 40% ABV, it has become a common and popular choice because it strikes a good balance between flavor and potency for many people.<>reddit_eli5
