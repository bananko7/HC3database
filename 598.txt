Why is n't waste just melted down and poured inside a volcano . Would n't the lava just nom nom it all ? Explain like I'm five.<>A lot of materials would burn , not melt . Some trash is burned , in incinerators . In fact , trash - burning incinerators are used as a source of heat for apartment buildings in some places ! However , not all trash is safe to burn . Fire is a chemical reaction that combines oxygen with whatever material is burning , and produces smoke and ash and other leftovers . Exactly what chemicals are produced in the smoke depends on what you burn . Some trash , such as dead batteries , can produce smoke that is poisonous . Even smoke and ash that do not contain directly harmful chemicals still pollutes the environment by making your air dirtier and contributes to global warming .<>Melting waste and pouring it into a volcano is not a safe or effective way to dispose of waste.\n\nVolcanoes are natural features that are formed when molten rock called magma rises up from deep within the Earth and erupts through the surface. They can be very dangerous and unpredictable, and it is not safe for people to be near them when they are active.\n\nIn addition, waste is not made of the same materials as magma, and it would not be able to melt or mix with the lava in a volcano. Instead, it would likely just sit on top of the lava and eventually be cooled and solidified by the surrounding rock.\n\nThere are much safer and more environmentally friendly ways to dispose of waste, such as recycling, composting, and properly disposing of it in landfills. These methods help to reduce the amount of waste that ends up in the environment and protect the health and well-being of people and animals.<>reddit_eli5
