Why do we sleep ? Why do we need sleep ? What is it , that makes us tired and forces us to sleep ? Explain like I'm five.<>From what I understand , even current researchers do n't know exactly why we need sleep . It 's easy to come up with plausible theories , and it 's easy to observe that we need sleep , but no one is quite sure why . This could be wrong , so take it with a grain of salt .<>Sure! Sleeping is a natural part of our daily routine that helps our bodies and minds rest and recharge. When we sleep, our bodies go into a state of relaxation and our brains are less active.\n\nOur bodies and brains need sleep in order to function properly. While we sleep, our bodies repair and grow new cells, and our brains process and consolidate memories from the day. Lack of sleep can affect our ability to think, learn, and pay attention, as well as our mood, mental health, and physical health.\n\nThere are a few different things that can make us feel tired and want to sleep, such as being physically or mentally active during the day, or not getting enough sunlight or fresh air. Our bodies also have internal clocks, called circadian rhythms, that help regulate when we feel awake and when we feel sleepy.\n\nSo, in short, we sleep to give our bodies and brains a rest and to help them stay healthy. Does that make sense? Let me know if you have any other questions.<>reddit_eli5
