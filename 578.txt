If languages simplify over time , why were they more complicated in the first place ? And what exactly determines whether a language at any point is going to become more complex or simpler ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Languages do n't get simpler , because simplification in one place means making something else more complicated . For example , English has no case system like , say , Russian . It used to have a case system , but it 's pretty much dead now . Good stuff , you might think , because the Russian case system means that the word for \" house \" can be \" dom \" , \" doma \" , \" domye \" , \" domu \" or \" domom \" , depending on its role in the sentence . But no case system means that in English , words have to go in a particular order , so \" Jack builds a house \" makes sense but \" A house builds Jack \" does n't . And then you have problems when you need to change the word order for certain reasons , meaning you have to add an auxiliary verb or construct a sentence with a relative clause , just so that the sentence means what you want it to say . How languages get complicated is a fascinating question , and it has no easy answer . I would recommend a book called * The Unfolding of Language * by Guy Deutscher , which attempts to explain how this could have come about in layman 's terms . Essentially , though , if you start with a very simple language , it can convey some basic concepts , but that might not be enough . You can say \" Jack builds house \" , but how do you express that , for example , the house is now complete , or that the construction is still in progress , or that Jack builds houses generally , or any one of countless subtle variations ? Here 's the sentence in an imaginary language : \" Jack pin dot \" . Some other words in this imaginary language are : \" pat \" = \" behind \" and \" dan \" = \" in front \" . Now we use these words to change the time of the building , thus : * \" Jack pin - pat dot \" = \" Jack built a house \" ( past tense ) * \" Jack pin - dan dot \" = \" Jack will build a house \" ( future tense ) Now , when people speak , they are fundamentally lazy , so \" pin - pat \" and \" pin - dan \" become , over time , condensed . Additionally , \" pinpat \" is difficult to say quickly , and the \" p \" causes the \" n \" to change to an \" m \" . So our sentences are now \" Jack pimpat dot \" and \" Jack pindan dot \" , and already we have a headache for future generations of students , who will have to learn this pattern under a fancy name like \" second declension \" . ( \" All verbs ending in ' -n ' fall into this category ; the ' -n ' mutates to ' -m- ' in the past tense . \" ) And so simple words added to sentences become prefixes , suffixes , particles and so on , evolving into a complex system of tenses , cases and so forth .<>Languages can change and evolve over time for many different reasons. One reason is that as a language is passed down from one generation to the next, it can change and adapt to the needs of the people who are using it. This can sometimes lead to a language becoming simpler, as words and grammar rules are lost or changed to make the language easier to use. However, languages can also become more complex for a number of reasons. For example, a language might borrow words or grammar rules from other languages, which can make it more complex. In some cases, a language might also develop new words or grammar rules to express new ideas or to better communicate in certain situations. It's difficult to predict exactly how a language will change over time, but it can be influenced by factors such as the culture and history of the people who speak the language, and how the language is used in different contexts.<>reddit_eli5
