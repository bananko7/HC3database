[ Math ] Can any of you explain Logarithms with detail from scratch ? Make sure to explain ln and e because that is what I do n't understand one bit . Please explain like I'm five.<>Logarithms are basically [ what you get when you count with multiplication rather than adding ] ( URL_0 ) .<>Sure! A logarithm is a way of expressing how many times a number must be multiplied by itself to get another number. For example, the logarithm of 100 to base 10 is 2, because 10 to the power of 2 is 100: 10^2 = 100 This can also be written as: log(100) = 2 The base is usually written as a small number to the right and slightly above the logarithm. For example: log10(100) = 2 The base is usually written as a subscript. For example: log10 100 = 2 The base can be any number, but the most common base is 10, and the logarithm of a number to base 10 is called the \"common logarithm\". The base can also be the mathematical constant e, which is approximately 2.718. The logarithm of a number to base e is called the \"natural logarithm\". For example: ln(100) = 4.605 The natural logarithm is written with the letters \"ln\". For example: ln 100 = 4.605 I hope that helps! Do you have any questions about logarithms or anything else?<>reddit_eli5
