Why do n't cable companies want us to have faster internet ? Do cable companies actually gain from us having slower internet ? Please explain like I'm five.<>It 's not that they * want * us to have slow internet . They simply do n't want to have to pay to upgrade their systems and infrastructure to make it faster . ISPs are monopolies , so they do n't need to worry about competition . And because they do n't have any competition , they do n't really have to care about the happiness of their customers , so long as the customers are n't so furious that they just quit using the product altogether . Their consumer base is set , so there 's no incentive to actually try and improve their product .<>Cable companies do want you to have faster internet, and they generally make more money when they provide faster internet to their customers. It's possible that there are some specific circumstances in which a cable company might not want to offer faster internet, but in general, they want to provide the best service they can so that they can keep their customers happy and attract new ones. It's also important to note that sometimes there are technical or logistical limitations that prevent a cable company from offering the fastest possible internet speeds to all of their customers. However, these limitations are usually temporary and can be overcome with time and investment.<>reddit_eli5
