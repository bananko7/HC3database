How to treat miles driven to the mechanic, gas station, etc when calculating business use of car?<>Since you are using the percentage method to determine the home\/business use split, I would think that under most circumstances the distance driven to get your car from the dealership to home, and from home to mechanic and back would be less than 1% of the total miles driven. This is an acceptable rounding error. When refueling, I typically do that on my way to another destination and therefore it's not something I count separately.  If your miles driven to attend to repair\/refueling tasks are more than 1% of the total miles driven, split them as you feel comfortable in your above examples. I'd calculate the B\/P percentages as total miles less maintenance miles, then apply that split to maintenance miles as well.<>When calculating the business use of a car, you should include all miles driven for business purposes, including miles driven to the mechanic or gas station. This means that if you use your car for business purposes and drive it to the mechanic or gas station for maintenance related to that business use, you should include those miles in your calculation of business use.To calculate the business use of a car, you will need to keep track of all miles driven for business purposes and all miles driven for personal purposes. You can then divide the total number of business miles by the total number of miles driven to determine the percentage of business use. This percentage can be used to determine the tax deductions or reimbursements that you are eligible for.It's important to keep good records of your business miles, including the dates, destinations, and purpose of each trip. You may need to provide these records to support your calculations if you claim a deduction or reimbursement for business use of a car.<>finance
