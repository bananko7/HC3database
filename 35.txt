The \" popping \" noise my bones make Like when I crack my knuckles \/ back ? What causes that sound ? What * is * that sound ? Explain like I'm five.<>The short answer is that we do n't precisely know what causes the cracking . The current top theory is that it 's cavitation inside fluid sacs within the joints . Cavitation is when small vapor - filled cavities appear inside liquid . The odd thing about them is that apart from vapor of whatever fluid they 're in , the cavities are vacuum , and thus almost immediately after forming , they 'll slam shut with a great deal of force , producing shockwaves in the fluid they 're in which can cause sharp popping noises , and even in some cases can cause light to be emitted . You can do a fun experiment with cavitation ( if you do n't mind destroying a glass bottle ) . Take an empty glass bottle and something rigid , and tap the top of the bottle with it ; the top of the neck with motion towards the base of the bottle . You can put quite a bit of force into it and not damage the bottle . Now , fill the bottle with still water and leave it uncovered for an hour or so to allow all the bubbles to leave , then whack the bottle in the same way . Once you hit a certain force , which is way less than the force required to break the glass , you 'll end up with the entire bottom of the bottle being blown out by cavitation shockwaves . You end up causing the bottle to move faster than the water within can keep up with , which creates vacuum bubbles at the base of the column of water inside the bottle , right above the base of the bottle . These cavitation bubbles will then slam shut , causing incredibly powerful shockwaves which will blow out the base of the bottle .<>The sound you hear when you crack your knuckles or back is caused by the release of a gas called nitrogen from the joints in your body. When you stretch a joint or move it in a certain way, it can cause the space between the bones in the joint to increase. This increase in space creates a small vacuum, which can cause the nitrogen gas to come out of the joint fluid and create a bubble. When the bubble pops, it makes a cracking or popping sound.
