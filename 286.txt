Why are male urinals not common in houses ? Although they may not look pretty and occupy space would help keep things clean and the wife happy . Seems like urinals need less water to flush also .. Please explain like I'm five.<>Sitting , better aim would also keep the wife happy . Why buy another toilet when there 's a sink ? Edit : what she do n't know ....<>Male urinals are not common in houses because they are typically found in public restrooms, such as those in airports, malls, schools, and office buildings. These places are designed for people who are not at home and need a place to use the bathroom when they are out and about. In a home, it is more common for people to use a toilet, which is a type of plumbing fixture that is designed for both men and women to use for urination and defecation. Toilets are typically more private and easier to use than urinals, and they do not take up as much space. They also use less water than a urinal when flushing, which can help save water and money on your water bill. Overall, while male urinals may have some benefits in certain situations, they are not as practical or necessary in a home setting, where people have access to a toilet.<>reddit_eli5
