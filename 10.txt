Why are fire hydrants In the US above the ground ? Here in the UK they are underground and unobtrusive . Also if they are underground vehicles ca n't crash into them and burst them . Explain like I'm five.<>This is just opinion , from a ( rather new ) volunteer firefighter . Hydrants were once called \" plugs \" , because the firemain was originally a system of underground pipes made of wooden logs . Firefighters dug down and drilled into them to get water . I , for one , am glad that we 've moved beyond having to dig for hydrants . In a city , some large buildings have standpipes to tie into for water ; but out in suburban and rural areas , the benefits of being able to easily see and access hydrants without having to dig for them seem to outweigh the risk of people hitting them . And ( again , this is opinion ) I do n't find them that obtrusive . Between mail boxes , street signs , trash cans , and the like , there are plenty of things by the roads . The hydrants , at least , serve a purpose in an emergency .<>In the US, fire hydrants are above ground because it is easier and more cost effective to install them that way. Putting fire hydrants underground would require digging a hole and then filling it back in after the hydrant is installed. This can be very time consuming and expensive, especially if there are a lot of hydrants that need to be installed.\r\n\r\nAlso, if the fire hydrant is above ground, it is easier for firefighters to find and use it in an emergency. If the hydrant is underground, the firefighters would have to dig it up before they can use it, which would take more time.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that above ground hydrants can be damaged by vehicles crashing into them, this is not a common occurrence. In most cases, the hydrant is able to withstand the impact and continue functioning properly.\r\n\r\nOverall, the decision to have above ground hydrants in the US was made because it is the most efficient and cost effective option.<>reddit_eli5
