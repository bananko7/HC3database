What is osteophytic lipping?Hello Dr. What is Osteophetic Lipping? I have been diagnosed to have osteophyetic lipping, and have been suggested to have surgery on my feet. Is it worth having this surgery? My work involves standing over 9hrs a day on my feet and I used to walk a lot, but always in flat sensible shoes. I have a lot of pain in my feet, and cannot do much walking, but job involves standing a lot. Would you kindly advise me on this. Regards Rochan<>Hi dear this just means that your joint pain cause is arthritis, this lipping is nothing but eburnations of bone around joint , formed due to degenerating cartilage, if your symptoms are worrying you please go for surgery as advised by your doctor.<>Osteophytic lipping is a condition where bony outgrowths, called osteophytes, form on the edges of bones in the joints. These outgrowths can cause pain and discomfort, as well as restrict movement. Osteophytes can form in response to wear and tear on the joint, or as a result of other underlying conditions such as osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nSurgery to remove osteophytes may be recommended if non-surgical treatments, such as physical therapy and medications, have not been effective in relieving pain and improving function. The decision to have surgery should be based on a thorough evaluation by a doctor, and should take into consideration the severity of the condition, the potential risks and benefits of the surgery, and the patient's individual needs and preferences.\n\nIf you are considering surgery, it is important to discuss your options with your doctor and to carefully weigh the potential risks and benefits. It is also important to keep in mind that surgery is not always successful and may not fully relieve your symptoms. In some cases, lifestyle changes, such as modifying your work activities or wearing proper footwear, may be effective in managing your condition and reducing pain.<>medicine
