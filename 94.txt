Is it truly possible to make a computer program that deletes its entire self and any evidence it was there in the first place ? Always wondered this . The ony programming I know is very simple C++ stuff and some arduino code . Please explain like I'm five.
Remember that the executing program is in memory , so it can delete any copy off the disk or whatever it loaded from , then reboot the system , which clears the memory .
It is theoretically possible to create a program that deletes itself and any evidence of its existence, but it would be very difficult to do so in a way that is completely foolproof and can't be traced. \nWhen a program runs on a computer, it leaves behind various types of evidence, such as files on the hard drive, entries in the operating system's log files, and even changes to the state of the computer's memory. A program that tries to delete itself would have to take all of these things into account and find a way to erase them. \nOne way to do this might be to create a program that runs in a loop, constantly checking for any evidence of its own existence and deleting it as it is found. However, this would be very difficult to do perfectly, and there is always the possibility that some evidence could be missed or that the program could malfunction in some way and leave behind a clue. \nIn addition, even if a program could successfully delete itself and all evidence of its existence, it is likely that someone could still potentially reconstruct the program or its actions by examining the state of the computer before and after the program ran. \nOverall, while it is possible to create a program that tries to delete itself and any evidence of its existence, it would be very difficult to do so in a way that is completely foolproof and cannot be traced.
