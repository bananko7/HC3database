How can celebrities admit to spending millions of dollars on cocaine and not be charged with any crimes ? Title pretty much covers it . Examples being Steven Tyler and Flavor Flav saying they 've spent millions on coke . Please explain like I'm five.<>I can walk up to a cop and tell him that I take ecstasy every day , and he has to prove that I do . The only thing he can do is search me and possibly get a warrant if he can convince a judge that I actually told him that and I was n't just being obtuse . It 's not illegal to be on , or to have been on drugs while not operating heavy machinery , it 's illegal to buy , sell , possess , and use drugs . Once you 've bought , possessed , and used the drug there 's no crime that you can be charged for .<>There are a few reasons why celebrities might admit to spending millions of dollars on cocaine without being charged with a crime: 1. They might have already been charged and served their sentence. In the United States, people who have been convicted of a crime and served their sentence (including any probation or parole) are considered to have \"paid their debt to society.\" This means that they are not punished again for the same crime. 2. They might not have been caught or charged with a crime at all. Just because someone admits to doing something illegal, it doesn't necessarily mean that they will be charged with a crime. In order to charge someone with a crime, the authorities need to have evidence that the person broke the law. 3. They might be protected by their wealth or fame. It is possible that celebrities with a lot of money or influence might be able to avoid being charged with a crime, or at least receive more lenient treatment, because of their wealth or fame.
