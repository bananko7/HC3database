They might be practicing a speech or presentation and are rehearsing what they want to say. 2. They might be trying to work through a problem or make a decision, and talking to themselves can help them think more clearly. 3. They might be experiencing symptoms of a mental health condition, such as schizophrenia or a mood disorder, which can cause them to hear voices or have abnormal thoughts that they feel the need to express out loud. 4.
