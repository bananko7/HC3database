the unsettling feeling produced when looking down while on top of a tall building And why is a similar reaction sparked even when viewing a picture taken from a high vantage point aiming down ? Explain like I'm five.<>This is a really interesting phenomenon ! Sometimes on the edge of a high place , you feel as though you 're almost being pulled to it . This is because in your brain , alarms are going off everywhere ( mostly in the amygdala , the part which processes fear ) telling you that you are in danger , yet your brain 's prefrontal cortex is also able to rationalize that you are not actually in danger . The conflict between these two processes creates the intense unsettling feeling . TL;DR : Your brain thinks you 're in danger , but knows you 're actually safe , and has a tough time dealing with both of these ideas simultaneously .<>Looking down from a tall building or viewing a picture taken from a high vantage point can be unsettling because it can make you feel dizzy or disoriented. This is because when you are high up, your brain is not used to seeing the ground so far away. It can also be scary because you are not used to being so high off the ground and there is a risk of falling. When you look at a picture taken from a high vantage point, it can also make you feel like you are falling or dizzy because your brain is trying to make sense of the image and it can be confusing. It's important to be careful when you are high up and to make sure you have a safe way to get back down to the ground.<>reddit_eli5
