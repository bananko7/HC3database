how is concrete poured on a steep incline ? Would n't Gravity make it hard to successfully level , flatten and smooth out a sidewalk being poured on a big hill ? Please explain like I'm five.<>My smart - ass answer was going to be \" from the top - pouring uphill is very difficult \" This video ( 1:21 min ) proves me wrong : [ Concrete Pour for Dam Time Lapsed ] ( URL_0 )<>Pouring concrete on a steep incline can be a challenging task, as gravity does make it difficult to level and smooth out the surface. Here's how it's typically done: \n1. First, the area where the concrete will be poured is prepared by clearing any debris and making sure the surface is stable and level. \n2. Next, forms are put in place to contain the wet concrete and give it the desired shape. These forms can be made of wood, metal, or plastic, and they are held in place with stakes or other support structures. \n3. The concrete is mixed in a large mixer or on site in a concrete truck. It is then transported to the pour site in the truck or in smaller batches in wheelbarrows. \n4. As the concrete is poured, it is spread out evenly using a shovel or rake. Workers may also use a screed, which is a long, flat board, to level the surface and remove any excess concrete. \n5. Finally, the concrete is smoothed and finished using trowels or other tools. This step is important to give the finished surface a smooth and attractive appearance. \nOn a steep incline, it may be necessary to use additional forms or support structures to hold the concrete in place while it is being poured and finished. The process may also take longer on a steep incline, as it may be more difficult to maneuver the concrete and the forms. However, with careful planning and attention to detail, it is possible to successfully pour and finish concrete on a steep incline.<>reddit_eli5
