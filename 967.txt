Does nutritional research vary so much because our species is evolving to counteract our diets or do we just know so little about nutrition ? Honestly feel like everyone is bs'ing because there are so many conflicting opinions on nutrition as a whole . Explain like I'm five. <>We know very little about nutrition . It is a remarkably complicated subject with some really advanced chemistry . Almost all of our advice is empirical , people tried it and it worked , they figured out how much of x people needed on average because people were getting sick without it . Evolution takes place over hundreds of thousands of years , and we as humans only started having easy access to food in the last century or two .<>Nutritional research can sometimes seem confusing and conflicting because there are many different factors that can affect a person's health and nutrition. These factors can include a person's age, gender, weight, height, activity level, and overall health. Additionally, different people may respond differently to different types of foods and nutrients, so what works for one person may not work for another.\\n\\nThere are also many different approaches to nutrition, and different experts may have different opinions about what is the best way to eat for optimal health. Some people believe in following a specific diet, such as a vegetarian or low-carb diet, while others believe in eating a variety of different foods in moderation.\\n\\nOverall, it's important to remember that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to nutrition, and it's important to find an approach that works for you and your individual needs. It's also important to talk to a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian if you have any questions or concerns about your nutrition.<>reddit_eli5
