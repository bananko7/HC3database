A cop is n't prevented from enforcing a law just because he did n't begin his interaction with you because you were breaking that law .<>DUI checkpoints, also known as sobriety checkpoints, are legal in California because they are considered to be a reasonable and effective way for law enforcement to identify and apprehend drunk drivers. These checkpoints are typically set up on roads and highways, and drivers who pass through them may be briefly detained and asked to provide their driver's license and vehicle registration. During a DUI checkpoint, officers may also look for signs of impairment, such as slurred speech or the smell of alcohol, and may ask drivers to perform a field sobriety test or provide a breath or blood sample to determine their blood alcohol content. While the primary purpose of a DUI checkpoint is to identify and arrest drunk drivers, officers may also use the opportunity to check for other offenses, such as suspended licenses or seatbelt violations. It is legal for officers to ticket or arrest drivers for these types of offenses if they are observed during a DUI checkpoint. Overall, the purpose of a DUI checkpoint is to help keep roads and highways safe by deterring drunk driving and identifying and arresting individuals who are driving while impaired.<>reddit_eli5
