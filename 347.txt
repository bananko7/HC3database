Should a high-school student invest their (relative meager) savings?<>If you have no immediate need for the money you can apply the Rule of 72 to that money.  Ask your parent's financial advisor to invest the money.  Based on the rate of return your money will double like clockwork. At 8% interest your money will double every 9 years.  45 years from now that initial investment will have doubled 5 times.  That adds up pretty fast.
