Why is \" circuit \" pronounced \" sirkit \" , but \" fruit \" is not pronounced \" frit \" ? English never ceases to dumbfound me . Please explain like I'm five.<>Because English is a mish - mash of rules and words from other languages .<>In English, the letter \"c\" is often pronounced as an \"s\" sound when it is followed by an \"i,\" \"e,\" or \"y.\" This is because the letter \"c\" has two different sounds in English. It can be pronounced as an \"s\" sound or a \"k\" sound, depending on the letters that follow it. \nFor example, in the word \"circuit,\" the \"c\" is followed by an \"i,\" so it is pronounced as an \"s\" sound. In the word \"fruit,\" the \"c\" is not followed by an \"i,\" so it is not pronounced as an \"s\" sound. Instead, it is pronounced as a \"k\" sound. \nEnglish spelling can be very confusing because the same letter can be pronounced in different ways, depending on the word. This is because English has a history of borrowing words from other languages, and the spelling of these borrowed words is often based on how they were written in the original language, rather than how they are pronounced in English.<>reddit_eli5
