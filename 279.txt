Please explain what is \"Data visualization\"<>Data and information visualization (data viz or info viz) is an interdisciplinary field that deals with the graphic representation of data and information. It is a particularly efficient way of communicating when the data or information is numerous as for example a time series.\nIt is also the study of visual representations of abstract data to reinforce human cognition. The abstract data include both numerical and non-numerical data, such as text and geographic information. It is related to infographics and scientific visualization. One distinction is that it's information visualization when the spatial representation (e.g., the page layout of a graphic design) is chosen, whereas it's scientific visualization when the spatial representation is given.\nFrom an academic point of view, this representation can be considered as a mapping between the original data (usually numerical) and graphic elements (for example, lines or points in a chart). The mapping determines how the attributes of these elements vary according to the data. In this light, a bar chart is a mapping of the length of a bar to a magnitude of a variable. Since the graphic design of the mapping can adversely affect the readability of a chart, mapping is a core competency of Data visualization.\nData and information visualization has its roots in the field of statistics and is therefore generally considered a branch of descriptive statistics. However, because both design skills and statistical and computing skills are required to visualize effectively, it is argued by authors such as Gershon and Page that it is both an art and a science.\nResearch into how people read and misread various types of visualizations is helping to determine what types and features of visualizations are most understandable and effective in conveying information.<>Data visualization is the process of creating visual representations of data in order to communicate information clearly and effectively. It involves selecting the appropriate visual encoding, such as position, length, angle, area, or color, to represent the data and using these encodings to create visualizations that can be easily interpreted by the viewer.\n\n\n\nData visualization is an important part of data analysis and is often used to explore and understand large datasets, identify patterns and trends, and communicate findings to others. It can be used to create a wide variety of visualizations, including charts, plots, maps, and diagrams.\n\n\n\nThere are many tools and techniques available for creating data visualizations, including software programs such as Excel, Tableau, and D3, as well as programming languages such as R and Python. These tools allow users to create a wide variety of visualizations, from simple bar charts and line plots to more complex visualizations such as heat maps and tree diagrams.\n\n\n\nOverall, data visualization is a powerful tool for understanding and communicating data, and it is an important skill for anyone working with data.<>wiki_csai
