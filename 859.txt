why does it sting when I put my contacts in if I have n't slept much \/well ? Thanks for the input everyone ! :) Explain like I'm five.<>Eye gunk ( Rheum ) is kinda floating around our eyes while we sleep . When we first wake up , it takes some time \/ binking for that to go into the corners of our eyes which we end up wiping away . Putting contacts in shortly after waking up , this stuff gets stuck behind the contacts and irritates the eyes ... Actually I have no idea why even if this explanation counts for anything ... its only a bit of the explanation ... ( must be more blood flow in the eyes , making them more sensitive or something ) I just hate putting my contacts in after not much sleep . Contacts \/ eyes suck . TR;DL : This is a useless explanation .... why am I typing right now ? Source : I wear contacts .<>When you don't sleep well, your eyes can become dry and sensitive. When you put your contacts in, they can irritate the dry and sensitive surface of your eye, causing a stinging sensation. Think of it like when you have a scratch on your skin and something touches it â€“ it can sting or hurt because the skin is sensitive and the scratch makes it even more sensitive. Similarly, if your eyes are already feeling dry and sensitive, putting contacts in can make them feel even more uncomfortable. To help prevent this, it's a good idea to make sure you get enough sleep and keep your eyes well-lubricated by using artificial tears or eye drops to keep them moist. This can help reduce dryness and sensitivity and make it more comfortable to wear your contacts.<>reddit_eli5
