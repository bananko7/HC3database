Why does putting a wooden spoon over a boiling pot prevent the water from spilling over ? Drunk and need answer . Explain like I'm five.<>It breaks the surface tension of the water before it spills over the edges .<>A wooden spoon can help prevent a boiling pot of water from boiling over because the handle of the spoon extends out of the pot and the steam from the boiling water hits the spoon and condenses on it. This causes the water droplets to fall back into the pot, which helps to lower the overall water level. The lower water level means that there is less chance of the water boiling over the top of the pot. So the wooden spoon acts like a little barrier that helps to keep the water inside the pot.<>reddit_eli5
