There are several possible causes of pain in the flank region, which is the area on either side of the spine between the lower ribcage and the pelvis. Some possible causes include:\n\nKidney stones: One of the most common causes of flank pain is kidney stones, which are hard deposits that can form in the kidneys and cause pain when they move through the urinary tract.\n\nUrinary tract infection: A urinary tract infection (UTI) can cause pain in the flank region, as well as other symptoms such as a frequent urge to urinate, pain or burning during urination, and cloudy or foul-smelling urine.\n\nMuscular or skeletal problems: Pain in the flank region can also be caused by problems with the muscles, bones, or joints in the back or pelvis, such as a strained muscle, a herniated disk, or osteoarthritis.\n\nDigestive issues: Abdominal conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or diverticulitis can cause pain in the flank region.\n\nIt's important to see a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment of your pain. They will be able to examine you, order any necessary tests, and determine the cause of your pain.
