If I have AD&D through my employer, should I STILL purchase term life insurance?<>I think that mbhunter hit the nail on the head regarding your question. I just want to add that having a policy that isn't sponsored by your employer is a good idea... employer policies are regulated by the federal government via ERISA. Independent policies are state regulated, and usually have better protections. Also, look for a policy that allows you to increase your coverage later without medical qualification so you don't need to overbuy insurance initially.<>It is generally a good idea to have a combination of both employer-provided insurance and personally purchased insurance. Employer-provided insurance, such as AD&D insurance, may not provide enough coverage to fully protect you and your loved ones in the event of an unforeseen event. Additionally, employer-provided insurance is often tied to your job and may not provide coverage if you leave your job or if your employer goes out of business.Term life insurance is a type of insurance that provides coverage for a specific period of time, usually 10, 20, or 30 years. It is generally less expensive than other types of life insurance and can be a good option for those who want to provide financial protection for their loved ones in the event of their death.Therefore, it is a good idea to consider purchasing term life insurance in addition to any employer-provided insurance you may have, to ensure that you have sufficient coverage to protect yourself and your loved ones. It is important to carefully review your insurance needs and discuss them with a financial advisor or insurance professional to determine the right amount and type of insurance for your individual situation.<>finance
