why someone who is making extra efforts to socialize with someone is deemed \" lame , or a loner ? \" I have seen it so much . \" She \/ he keeps texting me , how lame . \" Explain like I'm five.<>Its the same as when someone tries to act \" cool \" . You can tell they are trying to hard . When someone is trying hard to hangout with others , you get the feeling they do n't have anyone to hang out with , so in turn , you get the feeling they are \" lame , or a loner \" . Like when a guy has a girlfriend , he will get tons of girls hitting on him . But when he is single , you can just tell , and girls stay away .<>It's not necessarily true that someone who is making extra efforts to socialize with someone is deemed \"lame\" or a \"loner.\" People can have different opinions and attitudes towards socializing and making efforts to connect with others. Some people may appreciate and value being contacted and spending time with others, while others may not. It's important to remember that everyone is different and has their own preferences and boundaries when it comes to socializing. It's not productive or kind to label someone as \"lame\" or a \"loner\" just because they have different social habits or preferences than you do. It's always a good idea to be respectful and considerate of others and their feelings, regardless of whether you agree with their choices or not.<>reddit_eli5
