Who sets the \" Serving Sizes \" on packaging and why are they so ridiculously small ? I noticed this with [ Lucky Charms ] ( URL_1 ) as well as other products such as [ Macaroni and Cheese ] ( URL_0 ) . Explain like I'm five.<>The manufacturers set the serving size . They are ridiculously small so they can put smaller numbers in the unhealthy parts of the nutritional information , because most people do n't think to check the serving size .<>Serving sizes on food packaging are determined by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is a government agency that helps to ensure that the food we eat is safe and properly labeled. The serving sizes are meant to give people an idea of how much of a particular food they should eat at one time.\r\n\r\nThe serving sizes on food packaging are generally based on the amount of food that people typically eat at one time. However, they may not always reflect the amount of food that people actually eat at one time, especially if they are very hungry or if they are trying to lose weight and are trying to eat smaller portions.\r\n\r\nIt's important to remember that the serving sizes on food packaging are just guidelines and that people should feel free to eat more or less depending on their own needs and preferences. It's also important to pay attention to the other information on the food label, such as the number of calories and the amount of nutrients in each serving, to help make healthy eating choices.<>reddit_eli5
