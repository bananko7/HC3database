Himalayas So the Indian plate is colliding into the Eurasian plate to make the Himalayas , right ? Does this mean that , eventually , the Indian plate will no longer exist because all of it went into the Himalayas , or am I just being dumb ? Explain like I'm five.<>Eventually , it will be under the Eurasian plate . Parts of it will scrape up onto the Eurasian plate and stay there ; the spot where the plate is ' subducting ' - or going back down under the earth - is along the Himalayas . So it wo n't end up as giant mountains and just ocean . Plus , the Himalayas are constantly eroding and sending material back down near the sea . So the plate itself is moving closer to the Himalayas , but the Hiimalayas are sending parts of itself out to sea and onto land . At some point , the difference between the two will equalize , and then flip , so that the area we call India will be expanding again from erosion . If you look at the Farallon Plate in western North America , it is almost all subducted under the North American plate , but along the way , it left lots of surface material stuck onto the edge of the NA plate ( called accretion ) - which is what much of western California is actually made from . There will be plenty of accretion in India as well . The top layers of rock are the most crusty , and the lower layers the most ' mobile '<>\\nThe Himalayas are a mountain range that was formed when the Indian plate collided with the Eurasian plate. The collision of these two plates caused the land to rise up and form the Himalayas.\\n\\nThe Indian plate is still moving and colliding with the Eurasian plate, and this process is what is responsible for the continued uplift of the Himalayas. The collision of the two plates is also responsible for the earthquakes that occur in the region.\\n\\nThe Indian plate will not disappear completely because of this collision. Instead, the collision will continue to push the Himalayas higher and higher over millions of years. The process of plate tectonics, which is the movement of the Earth's plates, is slow, and it takes a long time for the effects of the collision to be visible.\\n\\nSo, to answer your question, the Indian plate will not disappear, but it will continue to push against the Eurasian plate, and this will cause the Himalayas to continue to rise.\\n<>reddit_eli5
