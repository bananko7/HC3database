Please explain what is \"Natural-language understanding\"<>Natural-language understanding (NLU) or natural-language interpretation (NLI) is a subtopic  of natural-language processing in artificial intelligence that deals with machine reading comprehension. Natural-language understanding is considered an AI-hard problem.\nThere is considerable commercial interest in the field because of its application to automated reasoning, machine translation, question answering, news-gathering, text categorization, voice-activation, archiving, and large-scale content analysis.<>Natural-language understanding (NLU) is a subfield of natural-language processing (NLP) that focuses on the ability of a computer to analyze, understand, and interpret human language. It involves taking unstructured text or speech input and extracting meaning from it, in order to perform tasks such as answering questions, generating responses, or carrying out commands.\n\n\n\nNLU systems typically use a combination of techniques from linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence to analyze the structure and meaning of language. This can involve identifying and analyzing the grammatical structure of sentences, recognizing and interpreting the meanings of words and phrases, and extracting information from text or speech.\n\n\n\nNLU has a wide range of applications, including chatbots, voice assistants, language translation systems, and information retrieval systems. It is an active area of research in computer science and artificial intelligence, and has the potential to revolutionize how humans and computers interact.<>wiki_csai
