Why does Blizzard take URL_0 offline every other Tuesday for maintenance , yet most other game services never go down ? For example , PSN and XBL rarely go offline . Please explain like I'm five.<>Most major mmos go down regularly for patching . Most mobas do as well .<>There are a few reasons why Blizzard takes its servers offline for maintenance on a regular basis. \nFirst, it is important for game developers to perform maintenance on their servers in order to fix bugs and make updates to the game. This helps ensure that the game is running smoothly and players are having a good experience. \nSecond, game servers, like any other type of computer server, can become overloaded or encounter issues that require them to be shut down in order to be fixed. This is especially true for games that have a large player base, as there may be more people trying to access the server at the same time. \nFinally, game developers often schedule maintenance at times when there are fewer players online, in order to minimize the impact on the player community. This is likely the case with Blizzard, which has chosen to perform maintenance on Tuesdays when there may be fewer players online. \nIn contrast, other game services, such as PSN and XBL, may not need to perform maintenance as frequently, or they may have more resources available to them to keep the servers running without interruption.<>reddit_eli5
