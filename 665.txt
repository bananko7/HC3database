Why do n't american presidents return to politics after their office terms ( eg become senator ) I 'm not a US citizen , so please correct me if they do , but I have never heard about it . Explain like I'm five.<>The Presidency is seen as the pinnacle of power in the US so becoming a senator or congressman would be a step down . Also it 's bad form . Who 's expected to run against a former president , and think how embarrassing it would be if the former POTUS lost the race .<>It is not uncommon for former American presidents to return to politics after their time in office. Many former presidents have served in other political roles after leaving the presidency, such as becoming a senator or governor. However, it is not a requirement or expectation for former presidents to do so. One reason that some former presidents may choose not to return to politics is that they may want to take a break from public service or spend time with their families. Other former presidents may prefer to focus on charitable or personal endeavors. Some former presidents may also feel that they have achieved all they want to in politics and are ready to move on to other things. Additionally, it is important to note that the Constitution of the United States places limits on how many terms a president can serve. A president can only serve two full terms in office, or a maximum of ten years. This means that a former president who has already served two terms cannot run for president again. However, a former president could still run for other political offices, such as senator or governor.<>reddit_eli5
