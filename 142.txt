why is having high blood pressure bad ? It seems like having more blood go to the rest of your body would be a good thing ! Please explain like I'm five.<>It 's bad because the heart is working inordinately hard . The heart has to push against that pressure . It also does n't necessarily get any more blood to the body since high blood pressure can cause hardening of the arteries . Or it may without warning get way too much blood to an important part of your body , such as the brain after popping a blood vessel . Just like your home 's plumbing is rated to withstand a certain pressure , your circulatory system can only handle so much before things start to break .<>Having high blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is not good for your health because it can cause damage to your blood vessels and organs. Imagine that your blood vessels are like the pipes in your house. When you turn on the tap, the water flows through the pipes to different parts of your house. In the same way, your blood flows through your blood vessels to different parts of your body. Now, imagine that the water pressure in your pipes is very high. This can cause the pipes to become weak or even burst, which can cause damage to your house. Similarly, when your blood pressure is too high, it can cause your blood vessels to become weak or damaged, which can lead to serious health problems. For example, high blood pressure can increase your risk of heart attack, stroke, kidney disease, and other health problems. That's why it's important to try to keep your blood pressure at a healthy level.<>reddit_eli5
