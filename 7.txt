If fire is n't one of the states of matter ( liquid , solid , gas , plasma ) , then what is it ? This is probably a stupid question , but I really do n't understand it . Explain like I'm five.<>Fire is the rapid oxidation of something that is the result of combustion . A flame ( visible part of a fire ) may be plasma , however , for most fires we experience it 's just the hot gases which are a product of the combustion .<>Fire is not one of the states of matter, but it is a chemical reaction that involves the release of heat and light. It is a process that occurs when a substance, called a fuel, reacts with oxygen to produce heat and light.\r\n\r\nTo understand this, let's first talk about the states of matter. There are three main states of matter: solid, liquid, and gas. These states are determined by the way the particles in a substance are arranged and how they move.\r\n\r\nIn a solid, the particles are closely packed together and do not move around much. They remain in a fixed position and hold their shape. Examples of solids include a rock, a block of wood, and an ice cube.\r\n\r\nIn a liquid, the particles are more spread out and can move around more freely. They take the shape of their container, but they can flow and pour. Examples of liquids include water, juice, and oil.\r\n\r\nIn a gas, the particles are even more spread out and move around very freely. They do not have a fixed shape and can fill any container. Examples of gases include air, steam, and hydrogen.\r\n\r\nPlasma is a fourth state of matter, but it is not as common as the other three. It is a type of gas that is made up of ions (atoms with a positive or negative charge) and free electrons. It is found in the sun and other stars, and it can also be created artificially in a laboratory.\r\n\r\nFire is not a state of matter, but it is a chemical reaction that can occur when a fuel is burned in the presence of oxygen. The fuel reacts with the oxygen to produce heat, light, and various other products, such as water and carbon dioxide.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps to clarify things for you. Let me know if you have any other questions.<>Fire is not one of the states of matter, but it is a chemical reaction that involves the release of heat and light.
