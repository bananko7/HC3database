If there is a charge for your reply, please do not reply.<>Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. We recommend  selective beta blockers  such as Nebivolol.However you should discuss this with your doctor. RegardsDr.Jolanda<>It is generally recommended to use a beta blocker with caution in people with asthma because beta blockers can cause bronchoconstriction, which can worsen asthma symptoms. However, some beta blockers are less likely to cause bronchoconstriction and may be safer to use in people with asthma. These include:\n\nAtenolol: Atenolol is a selective beta-1 blocker that is less likely to cause bronchoconstriction than non-selective beta blockers.\n\nMetoprolol: Metoprolol is a selective beta-1 blocker that is also less likely to cause bronchoconstriction than non-selective beta blockers.\n\nBisoprolol: Bisoprolol is a selective beta-1 blocker that has been shown to be well-tolerated in people with asthma.\n\nIt is important to note that even these beta blockers may still cause side effects in some people with asthma, and it is always important to discuss the use of any medication with your doctor to determine the most appropriate treatment for you. Your doctor will consider your specific medical history, the severity of your asthma, and other medications you are taking when deciding whether a beta blocker is appropriate for you.<>medicine
