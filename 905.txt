Are REIT worth it and is it a good option to generate passive income for a while?<>Other individuals answered how owning an REIT compares to an individual real estate investment, but did not answer your second question as readily, \"are REITs a good option to generate passive income for awhile?\". The \"awhile\" part is quite important in answering this question. If your intentions are to invest for a relatively short time period (say, 7 years or less), it may be especially advantageous to invest in a REIT. The foremost advantage comes from significantly lower transaction fees (stock\/ETF trades are practically\/potentially free today) compared to purchasing real estate, which involves inspection+titling fees\/taxes\/broker fees, which in a round-trip transaction (purchase and sale) would come to ~10%. The secondary advantage to owning a REIT is they are much more liquid than a property. If you wanted to sell your investment at a given point in time, you can easily log into your brokerage and execute your transaction, while liquidating an investment property will take time on market\/potentially tossing tenants\/fixing up place, etc. On the other hand, illiquid investments have generally yielded higher historical returns according to past research.<>Real estate investment trusts (REITs) can be a good option for generating passive income, as they allow investors to buy shares in a portfolio of income-generating real estate assets, such as commercial properties or apartments. REITs typically pay out a portion of their income as dividends to shareholders, providing a regular stream of passive income.However, like any investment, REITs carry some risk and may not be suitable for everyone. It's important to carefully consider your investment goals, risk tolerance, and financial situation before deciding whether to invest in REITs. It's also a good idea to diversify your portfolio by including a variety of different asset classes, rather than relying too heavily on any one type of investment.To determine whether REITs are worth it for you, it's important to research the specific REITs you're considering and assess their financial performance, management team, and other factors that may impact their risk and return potential. It's also a good idea to consult with a financial advisor or professional before making any investment decisions.<>finance
