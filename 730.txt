What is ' I Think , Therefore I Am ' ? Basically what the question says . I 've heard this concept \/ idea thing in Philosophy , ' I think Therefore I am ' . Someone explain this to me please ? Thanks . Please explain like I'm five.<>\" I think , therefore I am \" or ( \" cogito ergo sum \" in Latin ) is a famous phrase by French philosopher Rene Descartes . Like many philosophers , Descartes wondered how we can distinguish what is objectively real versus what we * perceive * to be real -- how do we distinguish something that is actually there , from what is simply a ( popularly shared ) hallucination ? One conclusion Descartes argued for is that beings can not rationally deny their own existence . We may question the reality of almost anything as potentially being figments of our imagination . However , to be able to ask the question \" do I exist ? \" , logically you must indeed exist . You might be wrong about the * nature * of your existence , but the existence itself is a logical prerequisite of self - analyzing thought . I can say that Descartes is not real , or that you are not real , but I think , therefore I must exist .<>\"I think, therefore I am\" is a famous quote from the French philosopher Ren√© Descartes. It is often called the \"Cogito\" because it starts with the word \"cogito,\" which is Latin for \"I think.\"The idea behind this quote is that the act of thinking is evidence that you exist. Even if you are not sure about anything else in the world, you can be sure that you exist because you are thinking about it. This is because, in order to doubt or question something, you must first exist in order to do the thinking.So, the quote \"I think, therefore I am\" means that the fact that you are able to think is proof that you exist. Does that make sense?<>reddit_eli5
