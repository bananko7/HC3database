What does Chlorine do in swimming pools ? why is it people can pee and bring germs into the pool , yet not get sick ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Chlorine kills bacteria ( germs ) , so you keep water mildly chlorinated and most germs die . Keeps people from getting sick . Home pools use chlorine but a lot less than public pools , the idea being less diverse bacteria ( and likely less people pissing and shitting in the pool since it 's privately owned and maintained ) .<>Chlorine is a chemical that is used to kill germs and bacteria in swimming pools. It is added to the water to help keep it clean and safe for people to swim in.Even if someone pees in the pool or brings germs into the water, the chlorine will work to kill those germs and bacteria. That's why it's important to make sure that there is enough chlorine in the pool to keep it clean and safe for everyone.It's also important to remember to shower before getting in the pool and to avoid swallowing the water while you're swimming.
