Citizen Kane is such a big deal in film . I hear a lot of talk about the movie and would like a little primer before I jump in and watch it . Explain like I'm five.<>It 's considered big in part because Welles was an innovative cinematographer that really used camera angles in new ways and to give the movie depth . It was also fairly controversial in that it was based on William Randolph Hearst , who owned like half the papers in the country at the time .<>Sure! \"Citizen Kane\" is a movie that was made a long time ago, in 1941. It's about a man named Charles Foster Kane, who is very rich and powerful, but also very unhappy. He tries to find happiness by buying lots of stuff and running for public office, but nothing seems to make him happy. The movie is called \"Citizen Kane\" because Kane is a citizen (a person who lives in a country) and his name is Kane. The movie is famous because it was one of the first movies to use a lot of new techniques in film-making, like using different camera angles and lighting to tell the story. It's also famous because the man who made it, Orson Welles, was only 25 years old when he directed it, which is very young for someone to make such a big and important movie. Citizen Kane is considered by many people to be one of the greatest movies ever made, and it is definitely worth watching if you are interested in movies or just want to learn more about the history of film.<>reddit_eli5
