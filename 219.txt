50 years ago when there were no computers , how could they design concert posters ? [ some posters are here ] ( URL_0 ) Also how could they make multiple copies of them ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Get this ! They 'd just draw them with their hands ! Are you actually 5 ? Lol printing has been around since like 1665<>50 years ago, people used a variety of methods to design and produce concert posters. One method was to use hand-drawn or hand-painted designs. An artist would create the design by hand, using pencils, paints, or other art materials. Once the design was complete, it could be reproduced by making copies using a printing press. Another method was to use graphic design tools such as drafting tables and tools, or even just paper and pencils, to create a design. The design would then be photographed and printed onto paper using a printing press. To make multiple copies of the posters, people would use a printing press, which is a machine that uses ink and pressure to transfer the design onto paper. The printing press would have a large roll of paper, and the design would be etched onto a metal plate. The plate would be covered in ink, and then pressed against the paper to transfer the ink and create the poster. The process could be repeated many times to produce multiple copies of the same poster. I hope this helps to explain how concert posters were made in the past. Do you have any other questions about this topic?<>reddit_eli5
