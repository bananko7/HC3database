Why is everything made in China ? I guess I 've just never understood the reason behind it . Economic ? Any explanations would be awesome , thanks ! Explain like I'm five.<>Wages in China are lower than in the Western world , so China attracted a lot of manufacturing business . You can pay someone $ 5 \/ day in China , or you could pay them $ 50 \/ day here in the US . The difference makes even the cargo costs to and from China worth it . As China has become more wealthy , we 've seen manufacturing begin to shift more to India , Bangladesh , etc .<>There are a few reasons why many things are made in China. One reason is that labor is cheaper in China compared to other countries. This means that companies can save money on manufacturing costs by producing their products in China. Another reason is that China has a large supply of raw materials and a large pool of skilled workers, which makes it easier and more cost-effective for companies to manufacture products there. Additionally, China has a large and growing market for consumer goods, so it makes sense for companies to produce products in the country where they will be sold. Finally, China has a strong infrastructure, including roads, ports, and airports, which makes it easier to transport goods both within the country and to other countries around the world.<>reddit_eli5
