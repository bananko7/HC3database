Q. Is it possible to get pulsating tinnitus due to tubes placed in ears?Hello doctor,Can tubes placed in ears cause pulsating tinnitus? I never had this prior to the tubes. I was getting dizzy all the time. So, they placed tubes in my ears.<>Hi. Grommets or ventilation tubes should not cause pulsatile tinnitus usually. Is your MRI normal? Can you share the report with me? Any other symptoms? Why were the tubes put in the first place?<>It is possible that tubes placed in the ears could potentially cause pulsating tinnitus as a side effect. Tinnitus is a subjective sensation of ringing, buzzing, or other sounds in the ears that is not caused by an external sound source. Pulsating tinnitus is a subtype of tinnitus in which the perceived sound is rhythmic and synchronous with the person's heartbeat.\n\nThere are a number of factors that can cause tinnitus, including hearing loss, exposure to loud noises, certain medications, and certain medical conditions. The placement of tubes in the ears, also known as myringotomy or tympanostomy, is a surgical procedure that is typically performed to treat conditions such as chronic middle ear infections or fluid buildup in the middle ear. While it is possible that the placement of tubes in the ears could cause tinnitus, it is not a common side effect.\n\nIf you are experiencing pulsating tinnitus after having tubes placed in your ears, it is important to speak with your healthcare provider about your symptoms. They can help determine the cause of your tinnitus and recommend treatment options.<>medicine
