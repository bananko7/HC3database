why are people given 200 years in prison ? I mean people die before 100 normally so why not just say life in prison ? Explain like I'm five.
People who get 200 years have committed multiple offenses and they want to make sure the convict gets a sentence for each offense .
People are given sentences of 200 years or more in prison as a way to punish them for very serious crimes. It is a way for the court to say that the person will be punished for a very long time, even if they do not live to be 200 years old. In some cases, a person might be given a sentence of 200 years or more because they have committed multiple crimes, and the court wants to make sure they are punished for each one.\r\n\r\nIt's important to remember that being sentenced to prison is meant to be a punishment, and the length of the sentence is one way to make sure the person is held accountable for their actions. Even if someone is given a long sentence, like 200 years, they may still have the opportunity to be released from prison early if they show that they have learned from their mistakes and are ready to follow the rules and laws of society.
