Why are grades ( elementrary , middle , hs ) based on age and not knowledge ? Seems kind of stupid Explain like I'm five.<>Well , this is not the reason , but I think if this were true , many high - school people would be in 3rd grade .<>Grades are based on age and not just knowledge because age is a good way to divide students into groups so that they can learn at a similar pace and with students who are at a similar level. This is called age-graded education.\r\n\r\nImagine if all the students in a school were mixed together and had to learn the same things at the same time, regardless of their age or how much they already know. It would be very difficult for the teacher to teach and for the students to learn, because some students would be too far ahead or too far behind.\r\n\r\nBy dividing students into grades based on their age, it becomes easier for teachers to plan lessons and for students to learn, because they are all learning the same things at the same time and are at a similar level. This helps to make the learning experience more enjoyable and effective for everyone.\r\n\r\nIt's also important to note that grades are not just about knowledge. They also measure things like effort, participation, and behavior. So even if a student is very knowledgeable about a subject, they might not get a good grade if they don't put in enough effort or if they don't follow the rules.<>reddit_eli5
