How are we able to draw maps over known parts of the universe ? How are we able to draw maps over known parts of the universe ? How much is it images and how much estimates ? Explain like I'm five. <>Well , when you take a spectrographic picture of the night sky you get the shape and distance to each point of light . Distance is computed from the red - shift of the light , particularly two specific hydrogen lines in the spectra . After that , it 's all math to take three dimensions : elevation ( how far up ) , azimuth ( how far east , considering the time ) and distance and convert them into any X , Y , Z system you want for your map .<>To draw a map of a part of the universe, we use information from various sources, such as telescopes and space probes, to learn about the objects and features in that part of the universe. We can use this information to create images of those objects and features, which can be combined to create a map.\\n\\nSome of the information we use to create these maps may be based on observations and measurements that are made directly, such as by taking pictures of objects or measuring their distances from us. Other information may be based on estimates and predictions about what is likely to be found in certain parts of the universe, based on our current understanding of how the universe works.\\n\\nOverall, creating a map of a part of the universe involves combining a variety of different sources of information, both direct observations and estimates, to create a detailed and accurate representation of what is known about that part of the universe.<>reddit_eli5
