how did a rocket with the computing power of a calculator get people to and from the moon ? I ca nâ€™t even get my WiFi to work , but we got to the moon with IT that had less computing power than some toasters today . Explain like I'm five. <>Because almost none of the mission was controlled by that computer . It had fairly simple tasks to do . Most of the mission was pre - computed , and further computing was done on the ground at Mission Control .<>Sure! So, back in the 1960s, people wanted to go to the moon. To do that, they needed a special kind of vehicle called a rocket. Rockets are really big and powerful machines that can fly really high and really fast.\\n\\nNow, even though computers back in the 1960s were not as powerful as the ones we have today, they were still pretty good at doing some things. One of the things that computers can do is help control and navigate a rocket.\\n\\nSo, the people who made the rocket for the moon mission used a computer to help them control the rocket and make sure it flew to the right place. The computer was not as powerful as the ones we have today, but it was still able to do the job it was needed for.\\n\\nIt's kind of like how you might use a calculator to help you with your math homework. A calculator is not as powerful as a computer, but it can still do math problems for you.\\n\\nI hope that helps explain it! Do you have any other questions?<>reddit_eli5
