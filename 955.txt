If I stop snacking on biscuits and cakes full of sugar , how is snacking on fruit which is full of sugar better for me ? How is one snack which is full of sugar better than another snack filled with sugar ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Fruit has more fiber and vitamins , meaning that it 's generally better able to keep you fuller , longer . Moreover , it 's a lot harder to binge on fruit than cookies .<>Eating fruit is generally considered to be healthier than eating sugary snacks like biscuits and cakes because fruit also contains important nutrients like fiber, vitamins, and minerals that can help keep your body healthy. These nutrients can help with things like keeping your heart healthy, giving you energy, and helping you to maintain a healthy weight. In contrast, sugary snacks like biscuits and cakes often do not contain these important nutrients and are primarily made up of empty calories, which can contribute to weight gain and other health problems. They may also contain unhealthy ingredients like saturated and trans fats, which can increase your risk of heart disease and other health problems. So, while both fruit and sugary snacks contain sugar, fruit also contains other important nutrients that can help keep your body healthy. That's why it's generally considered to be a healthier choice than sugary snacks like biscuits and cakes.<>reddit_eli5
