How does music copyright work ? Who ' owns ' a song ? Is it the songwriter , the music studio or the artist that records it ? Please explain like I'm five.<>I like your question because it is one of those things that , for all practical purposes , is a simple answer -- but it is a simple answer due to a lot of complicated parts . First off , when it comes to trying to understand ownership of \" intellectual property \" ( property that you ca n't physically touch ) , it is important to approach it layer - by - layer . Here , for example , we are talking about a \" song . \" For example , a song can be : * The potential of a recorded song ( lyrics you 've written down , a music composition you 're developing , etc ) . * A recorded song that you can listen to , share , etc . To help make this all clear , let 's break it down into different scenarios : * * Scenario # 1 :* * So let 's say that I am a songwriter . I have written a song that involves me singing while playing my acoustic guitar . I own the lyrics to my song under copyright and I also own the \" composition \" of me playing music accompanying those lyrics . This does n't mean someone else ca n't coincidentally come up with the same exact song on their own and own their version -- it just means that no one is allowed to straight up steal my lyrics and composition from me . * * Scenario # 2 :* * Same as Scenario 1 , except now I want to record my song . I decide to use my iPhone to record myself playing the song . I now own that recording of the song in addition to the components of the song ( lyrics + guitar playing ) . * * Scenario # 3 :* * Same as Scenario 1 , except now I want to record my song * * professionally * * . It takes effort and skill to properly record music . So I call my friend Bob who has a recording studio in his house , and I go over there and have him record me playing . Bob is a friend , so he sends me an MP3 of the recording after we are done . But who owns what ? I own the components of the song , but Bob owns that specific recording of me playing . This means that if I were to try to sell that MP3 , Bob would have a right to step in and stop me . It would be arguable that Bob gave me a * * license * * to use that MP3 in certain personal ways ( to play for friends , to upload it on my Facebook , etc . ) , but just because Bob recorded * me * playing * my * song does not mean I own * his * recording . After all , the recording is a product of his efforts , on his machinery . This is why concerts often do not allow fans to record the show and include specific legal small print on the tickets themselves ( or when you buy the tickets ) . Because when you record their show , YOU own that recording of the music . So if you were to share that recording , it would n't be infringement ... however , they will come after you under the guise of \" you agreed not to record , and you did , so you broke our agreement . \" * * Sidenote :* * Think of copyright as a sticky blob that comes into existence the moment someone \" creates \" something through their own efforts . Once it happens , un - sticking it from a person is complicated . The only way to defeat this is to make sure you have contracts in place that intercept the copyright from sticking . For example , if you pay me to make you a logo or code a website for you , I own the copyright on your logo or on the code of your website . Paying me just gives you a license to use it ( like in Scenario # 3 above ) . The only way for you to legally own a copyright for something I create is to have a contract before hand that says I am creating a \" work for hire , \" which means the copyright wo nt stick to me and , instead , sticks to you . * * Scenario # 4 :* * Like Scenario 3 , I want to record my music professionally but ca n't do it myself . It used to cost upwards of $ 250,000 to launch an album ( this includes all the costs from start to a finished , plastic - wrapped , designed album ) . In steps a \" Recording Label . \" A record label is just like an investor . Most people do n't have the money to successfully launch their album . Moreover , there are so many artists out there , it is hard for any one artist to get attention . Record labels are businesses that try to make a commodity out of music . They spot trends or potential \" start up \" artists , approach them , and say , \" Hey , we will cover all of the costs of producing your music in exchange for X% ownership of the final product ( the album ) . \" So I work with the record label and the employees of the record label ( all of whom have employment contracts that make their efforts \" work for hire \" for the record label ) to produce an album . Who owns what ? I still own the components of my music , because I created it before signing onto the record label . Without any contracts , the producers and audio engineers would each own a piece of the final recording , but like we already talked about , those things are pre - empted by contracts , so the end - ownership of the recording of my song is held by the record label . This means that if for some reason I decide I want to release my music for free , for example ... I would be violating the record label 's copyright to release the recording they own . That means I would need to re - record my song with a different studio , under a different contract that makes * the studio 's efforts * a \" work for hire , \" which gives me an exclusive copyright over the finished work . * * Scenario # 5 :* * Expanding on Scenario 4 , let 's say that I am such a big artist that the label is basically paying me a salary . They offer me $ 2 million per year to be \" contracted \" as an artist under their label . While under contract , I write a new song that is the biggest hit in the history of music . Who owns what ? As long as the label did their homework when they wrote the contract ( and you can be sure that they did ) , it will include language that makes me , basically , an employee of the label . Which means even though I wrote the song , the label paid me to write it via the salary . This means that I own nothing . Not the lyrics , not the composition , not the final product . * * TL;DR :* * Who owns what depends on the business deals going on behind the scenes . Absent any special circumstances , whoever \" touched it last \" generally owns the final product , but not necessarily all the components that went into the product . But those special circumstances almost certainly exist , especially in this day and age .

This means that only the person or entity that owns the copyright to a song can legally reproduce, distribute, or publicly perform the song. The songwriter is generally the first owner of the copyright in a song. However, if the songwriter creates the song as part of their job or assigns their copyright to someone else, then the employer or assignee will own the copyright. In some cases, a music studio or record label will own the copyright to a song if they have paid to have the song recorded and produced. The artist who performs the song does not usually own the copyright to the song, although they may have certain rights to use the song as part of their performances. It's important to note that copyright law can be complex and varies from country to country, so it's always a good idea to seek legal advice if you have questions about music copyright.<>reddit_eli5
