The link between autism and vaccination Heard a lot of different opinions on whether vaccines cause autism , and still ca n't get my head around the argument ! Explain like I'm five.<>Most parents of autistic kids start noticing the signs of autism right around the time their kid gets their second MMR vaccine , which tends to make them attribute the onset of the behaviors to the vaccine itself . That suspicion gets validated when they go online and find all kinds of conspiracy sites proclaiming the dangers of vaccines . My best friend 's youngest brother had a seizure following his second MMR , and then had a pretty severe regression in development . He was diagnosed autistic , and then later schizophrenic . It 's very hard for a family experiencing something like that to not want to blame the problems on the vaccine . It 's even harder to get them to trust vaccines again . They tend to discuss their suspicions a lot , so then you get a circle of friends who may also fear vaccines because \" a friend of a friend had x happen to their child . \" People look at the lobbying influence of pharmaceutical companies and see that they wield a lot of power in the government , and it makes it easy to believe that there 's some giant coverup happening . They question the importance of vaccinating against some diseases that have such low mortality rates , question the safety of bombarding an infant 's immune system with so many different vaccines at once , and then worry about whether or not they 're doing the right thing . Parenting is already hard enough without also having to worry that you 're either not protecting your kid from preventable disease or deliberately exposing them to a risk of autism . That doubt is what fuels the argument .<>There is no link between vaccines and autism. This is a false claim that has been debunked by numerous scientific studies.\r\n\r\nVaccines are a safe and effective way to protect against serious diseases. They work by introducing a small, inactive version of a virus or bacteria into your body. This triggers your immune system to produce antibodies, which help protect you against future infections.\r\n\r\nAutism is a complex developmental disorder that affects how a person communicates and interacts with others. It is not caused by vaccines or any other single factor. Instead, it is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.\r\n\r\nIt is important to get vaccinated to protect yourself and those around you from serious illnesses. It is also important to speak with a healthcare provider if you have any concerns about vaccination.<>reddit_eli5
