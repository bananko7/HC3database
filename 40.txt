Why did my hair change from blonde as a child to brunette in my teens ? Why did my eyes go from crystal blue to green \/ blue ? Hair from bright blonde to light \/ medium brunette ? I 'm male , it it matters . Explain like I'm five.
Hair and eye color darkens over time because the respective genes get turned on during your growth . For people to get the traits encoded in their genes , the genes need to be turned on . You can think of a gene as a recipe . A recipe in a cookbook does you no good until you open the book , get the ingredients and follow the instructions The same is true with our genes . In our analogy , the gene is the recipe and the cookbook is the chromosome ( a large collection of recipes ) . The gene needs to be \" read \" by the cell in order for it to do what it should . An unread brown or black hair recipe will give you blonde hair .
Your hair and eye color are determined by the genes you inherited from your parents. When you were a child, you had certain genes that made your hair and eyes look a certain way. As you grew older, your body changed and developed in different ways, and this can sometimes include changes to your physical features like your hair and eye color.\r\n\r\nYour hair color is determined by a pigment called melanin, which is produced by cells in your hair follicles. If you have a lot of melanin in your hair, it will be darker. If you have less melanin, your hair will be lighter. People with blonde hair have less melanin in their hair, while people with brunette hair have more melanin.\r\n\r\nYour eye color is also determined by melanin, but in this case, it is the amount of melanin in the front part of your eye called the iris. The iris has cells called melanocytes that produce melanin, and the more melanin they produce, the darker your eyes will be. People with blue eyes have less melanin in their irises, while people with green or brown eyes have more melanin.\r\n\r\nIt's not uncommon for people's hair and eye color to change slightly as they get older, and this can be due to a variety of factors, including changes in their hormone levels, diet, and overall health. In your case, it's likely that you simply inherited different genes that caused your hair and eye color to change as you grew older.
