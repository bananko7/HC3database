Why to I have to fight off heavy drowsiness 10 minutes into every meeting I attend ? Even when I 'm interested in the topic , it never fails . Explain like I'm five.
It 's because you 're passive ; you 're not engaging anything . Meetings , even of an interesting topic , are not often professionally designed to aggressively keep your attention like a TV show . It 's just Bob , rambling on about TPS reports . You 're probably sleep deprived , fatigued , and caffeinated at work ; stimulated and and engaging a subject is probably the thing that keeps you awake and alert normally . If you sat in your cube doing nothing for 10 minutes , I 'd wager you 'd pass out .
It's possible that you are not getting enough sleep at night, which can make you feel drowsy during the day. It's also possible that you are not eating enough healthy food, or that you are not getting enough physical activity, which can also contribute to feeling drowsy. Additionally, some people may have medical conditions that can cause drowsiness, such as sleep disorders or problems with their thyroid gland. Finally, it's possible that you are simply not as interested in the meetings as you thought you would be, which can make it hard to stay awake and focused.
