The nuclear foot ball That any computer in the world that has internet access can order a nuclear strike ... Edit : sry posted from my phone its \" nuclear football \" Explain like I'm five.<>Scroll down to the bottom , that site is not real . It also says Not over the whitehouse in the logo . Also it has parody written on the site header I do nt think you would ever see a method of launching weapons like that on the public internet , it would be far far to tempting a target for international hacking teams .<>The nuclear football is a briefcase that contains the materials and equipment needed for the President of the United States to authorize a nuclear strike while away from fixed command centers, such as the White House Situation Room. The briefcase is carried by a military aide who is always close to the President, so that the President can quickly give the order to launch a nuclear attack if needed.\n\nThe nuclear football contains a variety of items, including communication equipment that allows the President to communicate with military leaders and other government officials, and a list of pre-approved targets for a nuclear strike. It also contains the \"Presidential Emergency Satchel,\" which is a small suitcase containing classified materials and codes that the President would need to authenticate a nuclear strike.\n\nThe idea behind the nuclear football is to allow the President to be able to respond quickly to a crisis situation, such as an enemy attack, and to be able to give the order to launch a nuclear strike if necessary to protect the United States. However, it's important to note that the President does not have the authority to launch a nuclear strike on his or her own. The decision to use nuclear weapons is a serious one that involves many people in the government, and it is only taken in the most extreme circumstances.<>reddit_eli5
