Or given to other campaigns depending on the rules or situations . It is definitely illegal for the candidate to take that money and say , buy a house for themselves with it when they leave office .<>Political campaign fundraising is the process of seeking and collecting contributions from individuals, organizations, or companies in order to fund a campaign for public office. There are many different ways that candidates can raise money for their campaigns, including holding fundraisers, soliciting donations online, or accepting contributions from political action committees (PACs). The money that is raised during a political campaign is used to pay for a variety of expenses, such as advertising, campaign staff salaries, travel costs, and other expenses related to running the campaign. For example, a candidate may use campaign funds to pay for television or radio ads, to hire staff to help with voter outreach and get-out-the-vote efforts, or to cover the cost of renting a campaign headquarters. If a candidate wins the election, they may use some of the leftover campaign funds to pay for the transition to their new office, such as hiring staff or setting up their new office. If a candidate loses the election, they may return any unused campaign funds to donors or use the funds to pay off campaign debts. If a politician leaves office, they may still have campaign funds left over. These funds can be used for a variety of purposes, such as supporting other political candidates or causes, or they can be donated to charitable organizations.<>reddit_eli5
