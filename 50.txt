Why yellow man is an offensive term , but black man is n't . ELI5 : Why a black man is okay with being referred to as a black man , but an Asian man would be offended by being referred to as a yellow man . Explain like I'm five.
whether a word is considered offensive or not is entirely up to usage . if black people , as a group , found the term to be offensive , most people would generally treat it as such and stop using it . as it stands , some black people dislike the only other currently accepted term , \" african - american , \" for a variety of reasons , one being that many feel no connection to africa ( some trace their roots to haiti , for example ) , and others feel that the term is patronizing . other terms , such as \" colored , \" \" negro \" and \" afro - american \" carry painful historical baggage . consequently , hardly anyone uses them anymore , except for some elderly people . for similar reasons , american indians generally find the term \" native american \" distasteful , along with \" red man , \" which is what white americans called them in the 19th century , while they were busy relocating them to \" reservations \" or slaughtering them wholesale ( e.g. , wounded knee ) . any of these terms could one day no longer be offensive , if those who are offended by them cease to be so , or start using the term themselves as a way of taking ownership ( \" queer \" is an excellent example of a word that used to be a slur , but is now a term of pride among the LGBT community ) . for what it 's worth , \" yankee doodle \" was also a slur directed at american colonists by the british , but americans took ownership of that term , too , and made it a point of pride to sing the song with that name as a way of celebrating their own cultural identity .
It's important to understand that the way people are referred to can have a big impact on how they are treated and perceived by others. Using certain terms to describe someone based on their race or ethnicity can be hurtful or offensive because they can perpetuate negative stereotypes or imply that someone is being treated differently because of their race or ethnicity.\r\n\r\nThe term \"black man\" generally is not considered offensive because it simply describes a person who is a man and has black skin. It does not have any negative connotations or imply that the person is being treated differently because of their race.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the term \"yellow man\" is often considered offensive because it has been used in the past to demean and belittle people of Asian descent. It can be seen as a racial slur that perpetuates harmful stereotypes and implies that people of Asian descent are somehow different or inferior.\r\n\r\nIt's important to respect people's wishes and use terms that they prefer to be called, rather than using terms that could be hurtful or offensive.
