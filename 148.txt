What are linked lists in C programming ? Been trying to learn them for my CS1 class but they just seem extremely confusing . Anyway to dumb it down for me ? Explain like I'm five.<>The simplest way to store a list is just to have all the elements right next to each other . This makes things fast and all , but there 's an important disadvantage ; if you later decide you need to add on to the list , you have to make a new one completely from scratch , because there may not be any room left next to the list . So there 's an alternative called a linked list . Each element of a linked list contains a * value * ( the thing in the list ) , and a * pointer * . The pointer tells you where to go to find the next element of the list ; by following the pointers all the way through , you can go through the list .<>Sure! A linked list is a way to store a list of items in a computer's memory. Instead of having all the items in a big block of memory, like in an array, the items are stored in smaller blocks that are scattered around in memory. Each of these smaller blocks is called a \"node.\"\n\nEach node has two parts:\n\nSome data (for example, a number or a character)\nA pointer to the next node in the list\nThe first node in the list is called the \"head\" of the list. The last node in the list is called the \"tail\" of the list.\n\nHere's an example of how a linked list might look in memory:\n\nCopy code\n        +-------+    +-------+    +-------+    +-------+\nhead --->| node  |----| node  |----| node  |----| node  |---> NULL\n        | data: 1|    | data: 2|    | data: 3|    | data: 4|\n        | next:  |--->| next:  |--->| next:  |--->| next:  |--->\n        +-------+    +-------+    +-------+    +-------+\nTo access a particular node in the list, you start at the head and follow the pointers until you reach the node you want. For example, to get to the third node in the list above, you would start at the head, follow the pointer to the second node, and then follow the pointer to the third node.\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.<>reddit_eli5
