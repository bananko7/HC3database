What 's stopping a police officer from conducting an unlawful search and later claiming that the accused gave permission ? How would a case like this be handled if there were no witnesses and both the officer and defendant claimed something different ? Explain like I'm five.<>Nothing is stopping him , short of his own decency .<>There are a few things that can help prevent police officers from conducting unlawful searches and then claiming that the accused gave permission. Here are a few examples:\r\n\r\nThe accused can refuse to give permission for the search. If the police officer tries to search without a warrant, the accused can say \"I do not give you permission to search my property.\" This can help prevent the officer from later claiming that the accused gave permission.\r\n\r\nThe accused can document the search. If the accused has a phone with a camera, they can take pictures or video of the search. This can provide evidence of what happened and what was said during the search.\r\n\r\nThe accused can get a lawyer. If the accused is arrested or charged with a crime as a result of the search, they have the right to get a lawyer to defend them in court. A lawyer can help the accused challenge the legality of the search and any evidence that was obtained as a result of the search.\r\n\r\nIf there are no witnesses and both the officer and the accused claim something different, it can be difficult to determine what really happened. In these cases, the judge or jury will have to decide who is telling the truth based on the evidence that is presented in court. This may include any documentation (such as pictures or video) that the accused has, as well as testimony from the officer and the accused.<>reddit_eli5
