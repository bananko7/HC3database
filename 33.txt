Explain like I'm five.<>[ Ape vs Monkey ] ( URL_0 ) comparison chart . Hope this helps .<>Sure! I'd be happy to help explain the difference between apes and monkeys to you.\n\nApes and monkeys are both types of primates, which are a group of mammals that include humans. However, there are some key differences between apes and monkeys.\n\nOne of the main differences is that apes are larger and have bigger brains than monkeys. Apes also do not have tails, while monkeys do. Additionally, apes are generally more intelligent and have more complex social behaviors than monkeys.\n\nApes include gorillas, chimpanzees, and orangutans, while monkeys include species such as baboons, macaques, and marmosets.\n\nSo to summarize, apes are larger, more intelligent primates that do not have tails, while monkeys are smaller primates that have tails. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.<>reddit_eli5
