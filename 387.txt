Why do you have to turn off your electronics at the beginning of a flight ? It never made sense to me . Please and thank you ! Explain like I'm five.<>When I was last on an airline , they asked that we turned all of our electronics off , while some of these are supposed to remain off for the duration of the flight ( cell phones , wifi , GPS etc ) , these are known to interfere with some airline equipment . However , I asked the flight attendent and other electronics ( cameras , iPods , etc ) are supposed to reduce the distraction by you or others from the safety information provided by attendants , and the pilot . * * TL;DR * * ; to avoid distraction during take - off where things can go wrong .<>During a flight, it is important to turn off electronics because they can interfere with the plane's navigation and communication systems. Imagine you are on a car trip with your family and you are all trying to listen to the GPS at the same time. It might be hard to hear because everyone is talking over each other. It's the same idea with a plane. The plane has lots of important electronics that help the pilots fly the plane safely, and if other electronics are on and making noise, it can be hard for the pilots to hear and use the equipment they need to fly the plane. That's why it's important to turn off all electronics during a flight. Does that make sense?<>reddit_eli5
