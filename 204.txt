Why are cigarettes legal ? I just ca n't wrap my head around it . They are known to cause cancer and to contaim a large amount of toxic materials , so how come are they still legal ? Explain like I'm five.<>An extremely powerful lobbying group and most importantly , the government makes oodles of cash taxing them . It 's also important to recognize that \" second hand \" smoke was n't well studied until recently , so if you were only hurting yourself then should n't you have the freedom to do so if you choose ? This is why you see so many states passing public smoking bans within the last decade or so .<>Cigarettes are legal because they were widely used and accepted before it was fully understood how harmful they are to people's health. Now that we know that smoking cigarettes can cause serious health problems, like lung cancer and heart disease, efforts have been made to reduce the number of people who smoke and to make cigarettes less accessible, especially to young people. For example, many countries have laws that require warning labels on cigarette packages, prohibit cigarette advertising, and restrict the sale of cigarettes to people under a certain age. Despite these efforts, cigarettes are still legal to purchase and use because they are not completely banned in most countries. This is because cigarettes are considered to be a legal adult product, and adults are allowed to make their own decisions about whether or not to use them, even if they are harmful.<>reddit_eli5
