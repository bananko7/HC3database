Reddit ( I ca n't figure out how to easily explain it to a friend ) My friend asked me to explain reddit , but I just ca n't figure out how ... Thanks guys ! Explain like I'm five.<>Reddit sifts through the internet for what 's most relevant for you so you do n't have to .<>Sure! Reddit is a website where people can share and discuss things they're interested in. It's kind of like a big online discussion forum, where people can post pictures, links, and questions and other people can respond with their own thoughts and ideas. On Reddit, there are different \"communities\" called \"subreddits\" that focus on specific topics. For example, there might be a subreddit about cats, or a subreddit about video games, or a subreddit about politics. You can subscribe to the subreddits that interest you, and then you'll see the posts and discussions from those communities in your personal feed. People can also \"upvote\" or \"downvote\" posts and comments on Reddit, which is a way for people to say whether they like something or not. Posts and comments with more upvotes tend to be more popular and visible on the site. Hope that helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.<>Sure!
