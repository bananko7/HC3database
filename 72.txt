\" rape culture \" I see this term thrown around a lot but what does it actually mean ? Explain like I'm five.<>Excerpt taken from [ this ] ( URL_0 ) page : Rape culture , could be summarised as : * A collection of beliefs in society that allows the mindset and behaviours that lead to rape to flourish . These are beliefs like , * Only slutty girls get raped\/“Good girls ” do n’t get raped * They were drunk , so it was okay * It ’s not rape if you enjoyed it * All men are horny anyway , men ca n’t get raped * Rape jokes are just that - jokes . There are many , many , many more examples . Personally , I would say that rape culture is the collection of ideas and behaviors that do one of the following things : 1 . ) Support the idea that rape victims are ( partially ) responsible for their own rape 2 . ) Excuse or reduce the blame put on rapists 3 . ) Make it more difficult for rape victims to speak out , seek recluse or seek justice 4 . ) Make light of rape or make ( some forms of ) rape seem like less servere crimes , mistakes or even ' normal ' sexual behavior . 5 . ) Make it easier for rapists to hide , obfuscate or justify their behavior<>Rape culture refers to the ways in which society normalizes or excuses sexual violence and assault. It can also refer to the ways in which society blames victims of sexual violence and fails to hold perpetrators accountable for their actions.\r\n\r\nFor example, if people make jokes about rape or sexual assault, or if they blame the victim for what happened to them (e.g., by saying that the victim was dressed provocatively or was \"asking for it\"), this contributes to a culture in which sexual violence is seen as acceptable or normal.\r\n\r\nIt's important to recognize and challenge rape culture, because it can create an environment in which sexual violence is more likely to occur, and in which victims may be afraid to speak out or seek help. By standing up against rape culture, we can work towards creating a safer and more respectful society for everyone.<>reddit_eli5
