Why doesn't the emerging markets index reflect GDP growth?
GDP being a measurement for an economy's growth and with the stock market being driven (mostly) by company profits you would expect a tight correlation between GDP growth and stock market performance. After all, a growing economy should lead to a corresponding increase in profit right? But the stock market is heavily influenced by investor mentality; irrational exuberant buying and panic selling make the stock market far more volatile than GDP ever can be. Just look at the 2001 bubble and 2008 panic sell-off for famous examples. I feel emerging markets are particularly prone to overly optimistic buying to \"get in\" on the GDP growth followed by overly pessimistic selling when politics get unfavorable. Also keep in mind that GDP measurements are all done after the fact, the growth that is reported has already happened. The stock market might have already expected the reported growth and priced it in. A final point: governments and companies in emerging markets have a reputation (sometimes deserved) of poor governance, think corruption, nepotism etc. So even if the economy grows substantially investors might not believe they can profit from the growth.  P.S. What do you base the \"no great increase\" on? Emerging markets have had a rough decade but that index would have still returned 9% annually if you held it since 2001.
The emerging markets index is a stock market index that is designed to track the performance of publicly traded companies in developing economies. It is not intended to directly reflect the gross domestic product (GDP) growth of the countries in which these companies are located.There are several reasons for this. First, the emerging markets index is a market-based measure, while GDP is an economic measure. As such, they are based on different data sources and are calculated using different methods.Second, the performance of a stock market index is influenced by a variety of factors, including company-specific factors such as earnings, dividends, and management, as well as broader economic and market conditions. GDP growth is just one of many factors that can affect the performance of the emerging markets index.Finally, it's important to note that the emerging markets index is not intended to be a comprehensive measure of the economic performance of developing economies. It is simply a tool for tracking the performance of a specific group of publicly traded companies in these economies.
