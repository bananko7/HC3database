How does blowing something cool it down ? Like a cup of coffee or a hot turnip .... Please explain like I'm five.<>When things cool down , they 're really just moving heat from a hot thing to a cold thing . And the movement happens faster when there 's a bigger difference between the hot thing and the cold thing . But that means the process slows . The hot thing gets cooler , but the cool thing gets warmer . They get a lot closer together . In the case of a cup of coffee , it 's being cooled by the air around it . And the air around it is getting warmer too . You can speed the cooling process along by getting that warm air out of the way , increasing the temperature difference between the coffee and the air around it . It 's the same principle that makes a breeze or a fan cool you on a hot day .<>When you blow on something, you are using your breath to move air over the surface of the object. The air that you blow is cooler than the object, so when it comes into contact with the object, it can transfer some of its coolness to the object, causing the object to lose heat. \nThink of it like this: if you have a hot piece of metal and you want to cool it down, you could blow on it or wave a fan over it to help dissipate the heat. The same principle applies when you blow on a hot cup of coffee or a hot turnip. The air that you blow will transfer some of its coolness to the object, causing it to cool down. \nIt's important to note that this process will only work to a certain extent, and it may not be the most effective way to cool down an object quickly. There are other methods that are more effective at removing heat from an object, such as placing the object in a cooler environment or using a refrigeration device.<>reddit_eli5
