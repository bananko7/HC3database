Investments beyond RRSP and TFSA, in non-registered accounts?<>You haven't looked very far if you didn't find index tracking exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the Toronto Stock Exchange. There are at least a half dozen major exchange-traded fund families that I'm aware of, including Canadian-listed offerings from some of the larger ETF providers from the U.S. The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) maintains a list of ETF providers that have products listed on the TSX.<>Non-registered accounts are investment accounts that are not registered with the government, such as a traditional brokerage account. They are called non-registered because they are not registered under a specific tax-sheltered plan, such as a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) or a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA).Investments in a non-registered account are subject to tax on any capital gains or dividends earned, but they also offer more flexibility in terms of the types of investments that can be held and the ability to withdraw funds without tax consequences.Some options for investments in a non-registered account include:Stocks: You can invest in individual stocks or mutual funds that invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks.Bonds: You can invest in individual bonds or bond mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs).GICs: Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs) are a type of low-risk investment that offers a guaranteed return over a set period of time.Real estate: You can invest in real estate through the purchase of rental properties or through real estate investment trusts (REITs).Alternative investments: Non-registered accounts also allow you to invest in alternative assets such as private equity, venture capital, and hedge funds.It's important to remember that all investments come with some level of risk, and it's important to do your due diligence and understand the risks and potential returns before making any investment decisions. It may also be a good idea to speak with a financial advisor or professional to determine the best investment strategy for your individual circumstances.<>finance
