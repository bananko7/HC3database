What happens if I intentionally throw out a paycheck?<>In a nutshell, throwing your taxable income in the trash does not remove it from your taxable income; you still have to report in your tax filing, and pay taxes as needed. Especially as you could at any time request your employer to write you a replacement check. I would expect them to start charging a fee for reprinting if you really annoy them by doing it dozens of times. If you want to avoid taxes on it, donate it to a deductible 501(c)3 organization; then it becomes neutral to your taxes.<>If you intentionally throw out a paycheck, it means that you are refusing to accept payment for the work that you have done. This can have serious consequences, depending on the circumstances. Here are a few potential outcomes:You may be considered to have quit your job, which means that you will no longer be employed and will not receive any further paychecks.Your employer may pursue legal action against you for breach of contract, particularly if you have signed a contract stating that you will accept payment for your work.Your employer may report you to the authorities for theft or embezzlement, depending on the specific circumstances.In general, it is not a good idea to intentionally throw out a paycheck or refuse to accept payment for the work that you have done. If you have concerns about your employment or your pay, it is important to address those issues directly with your employer rather than taking drastic action like throwing out a paycheck.<>finance
