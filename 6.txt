Scratching it spreads the spores around and helps to infect more of your skin . The skin thickening is because that 's what the fungal growth does to the skin , and the scaling \/ shedding is the body trying to reject the dead and infected skin .<>Jock itch is a fungal infection that affects the skin in the groin area. It causes itching and redness, and sometimes a rash or flaky skin.\n\nScratching the infected area can make the condition worse because it can irritate the skin and cause it to become more inflamed. It can also break the skin and allow the fungus to spread to other areas of the body or to other people.\n\nSometimes people develop tough skin or shed skin around the affected area because the fungus can cause the skin to become dry and damaged. The body may try to repair the damaged skin by producing extra skin cells, which can lead to tough or flaky skin.\n\nIt's important to avoid scratching the infected area and to follow the treatment recommended by your doctor in order to help clear up the infection and prevent it from spreading or getting worse.<>reddit_eli5
