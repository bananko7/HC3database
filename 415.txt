Are the flakes in Goldschlager dangerous in any way ? I know that if you swallow coins , you 're stomach acids wo n't digest them . Does that apply to all metals ? Would it be possible for a flake to cut your intestine ? Explain like I'm five.<>If you can drink enough goldschlager to where the gold becomes a problem you 've got bigger problems .<>Goldschlager is a liqueur that contains thin flakes of gold leaf suspended in the liquid. The gold flakes are not dangerous to swallow because they are so thin and small that they will pass through your digestive system without causing any harm. They are not sharp enough to cut your intestine.\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that you should not swallow any foreign objects, including coins, because they can cause problems in your digestive system. Coins can get stuck in your throat or esophagus and cause choking, or they can get stuck in your stomach or intestine and cause blockages. These problems can be serious and may require medical attention. So it's best to avoid swallowing any foreign objects, including gold flakes.<>reddit_eli5
