How is Scientology legal ? And more specifically , given the events of Operation Snow White , not to mention the craziness of Operation Freakout . Plus the number of assassinations against journalists . How is it not labeled as a domestic terrorist organization ? Please explain like I'm five.<>They have really good lawyers and lobbyists .<>Scientology is a religious organization that is recognized as such in many countries around the world. As such, it is protected by laws that guarantee freedom of religion. This means that people are free to practice Scientology, and the government cannot prohibit it or punish people for their religious beliefs. In the United States, the First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees the right to freedom of religion, which means that the government cannot interfere with a person's religious beliefs or practices. This applies to all religions, including Scientology. Operation Snow White and Operation Freakout were illegal activities carried out by members of the Church of Scientology in the 1970s. These actions were condemned by the Church and those responsible were punished. It is important to note that the actions of a few individuals should not be used to label an entire organization as a \"domestic terrorist organization.\" As for the allegations of assassinations against journalists, I am not aware of any credible evidence to support these claims. It is important to carefully consider the source of such information and to verify it with reliable sources before drawing conclusions.<>reddit_eli5
