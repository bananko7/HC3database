how is it that noise cancelling headphones can reduce decibels when in essence they are adding more sound ? i understand active noise reduction emits a sound equal to the noise with an inverted phase but why do the 2 sounds together have less sound pressure ? Explain like I'm five.
What happens if you push on a shopping cart , and your equally - strong cousin pushes it the other way ? Nothing happens , right ? This is exactly what noise cancelling headphones do . When the sound waves are pushing into your ears , the sound from the headphones is pulling out , and when the noise pulls air from your ear , the headphones sound pushes in . They both cancel in your ear canal , and the resulting nothing gets to your ears .
Noise cancelling headphones work by using microphones to detect incoming noise, and then producing an \"inverse\" sound wave that cancels out the noise. This is similar to how when you add two waves together, the result can be silence if the waves are \"out of phase\" with each other, meaning they are exactly opposite.\r\n\r\nFor example, imagine you are standing near a speaker that is producing a loud, steady tone. If you were to hold a microphone up to the speaker and then play the sound that the microphone picks up through a second speaker, the two speakers would cancel each other out and you wouldn't be able to hear anything. This is because the sound waves from the two speakers are exactly out of phase with each other and therefore cancel each other out.\r\n\r\nNoise cancelling headphones work in a similar way, but instead of using two speakers, they use a microphone and a special processor to detect the incoming noise and produce a sound wave that is out of phase with the noise. When you put the headphones on and turn on the noise cancelling feature, the processor creates the inverse sound wave and plays it through the headphones, which cancels out the noise and makes it much harder to hear.\r\n\r\nSo, even though the headphones are adding more sound to your ear, the sound waves from the headphones and the noise are exactly opposite, so they cancel each other out and you end up hearing less overall sound.
