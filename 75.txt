how come most high schools do n't teach you how to do taxes or buy a house or car ? It seems like not very many school do this so just wondering . Explain like I'm five.
Some view school as the place you go to be taught academic subjects . Life skills such as cooking , changing the oil , doing taxes , etc . are viewed as skills most adults have and should pass on to their children . This is not necessarily what happens in reality , but it is the reason schools put less emphasis on life skills . As time goes on , it seems like fewer people actually have what used to be considered basic life skills ( most of my friends have no idea how to cook , yet a generation ago most people cooked their own food ) . But , what is in the school curriculum is , to a great extent , a political battle controlled by people who want to maintain the current societal structure , so common sense is rarely part of the decision .
High schools generally focus on teaching students a broad range of subjects that are considered to be important for their overall education and development. These subjects typically include math, science, language arts, social studies, and various elective courses.\n\nTaxes and financial management, such as buying a house or a car, are important life skills, but they may not be included in the regular curriculum of most high schools. This is because these topics can be quite complex and require a certain level of maturity and understanding that some high school students may not have.\n\nAdditionally, schools have limited time and resources, and they need to prioritize which subjects to teach. Because there are so many different things that students need to learn in high school, it may not be possible to cover every topic in depth.\n\nHowever, some high schools may offer elective courses or extracurricular activities that cover topics like financial management and budgeting. These courses may be optional and students can choose to take them if they are interested in learning more about these topics.
