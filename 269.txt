If concentrated light , like a laser , can fix our poor vision ; why ca n't we stare at the sun therapeutically ? Edit : okay so it 's basically eye obliteration , thanks my dudes . Explain like I'm five.<>A bit of metal , scraped just right , can help clean your teeth . But i do n't recommend having a car hit you in the face . Using very precise lasers at very specific angles they are able to shave a small amount off the front of your eye . When you look at the sun you are getting orders of magnitude more photons and energy pooring at your retna . It can not handle that .<>\\nStaring at the sun is not a good way to try to improve your vision because the sun is extremely bright and looking directly at it can damage your eyes. The light from the sun is so bright that it can burn the special cells in your eyes that help you see, and this can cause permanent damage to your vision. This is why it is important to always wear protective eyewear, like sunglasses, when you are outside on a sunny day.\\n\\nLasers can be used to help improve vision, but they are used in a very controlled way by trained medical professionals. Laser light is much less bright than the sun, and it is used in a specific way to help correct certain vision problems. It is not safe to try to use the sun or any other bright light as a way to try to improve your vision on your own.<>reddit_eli5
