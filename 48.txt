How cutting \/ slicing works atomically ? Like does a knife smash the food atoms or split them down the middle ? And does cutting something like food differ atomically from cutting paper ? Please explain like I'm five.<>... If you split an atom , you 'd get a fission bomb . ( What blew up Hiroshima ) . Interestingly enough though , Atom comes from the Greek meaning ' impossible to cut' ... because of people thinking about this question in exactly the same manner . Easy answer : There are two kinds of cutting , sharp and serrated cuts . Sharp are pure pressure and split the object into two masses ; while serrated ( with a steak knife or a saw ) cuts by removing a lot of matter and creating a gap . ... that 's the best I can do .<>Atoms are the building blocks of matter, and they are extremely small. When you cut something, you are using a blade to physically separate the material into two or more pieces. The blade does not \"smash\" the atoms or split them down the middle. Instead, it creates a new surface by moving the atoms around and creating a clean break. When you cut food, the blade of the knife pushes through the food and separates the atoms and molecules that make up the food. The atoms and molecules themselves are not damaged or destroyed in the process. The same is true when you cut paper or any other material. The blade simply rearranges the atoms and molecules to create a new surface. So, to summarize, cutting does not involve smashing or splitting atoms. It simply involves rearranging them to create a new surface.<>reddit_eli5
