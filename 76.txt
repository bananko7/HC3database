How does a sailboat sail into the wind ? I do n't live anywhere near an ocean . I do n't get it . Explain like I'm five.<>Sails at a 15 % angle to your boat will , when blown on from the front , push your boat forward , allowing you to sail perpendicular to the wind . So you tack the boat , switching sides , never sailing directly into the wind , but rather across it . Here 's a handy picture . URL_0<>Sure! A sailboat is able to sail into the wind because of the shape and angle of its sails. The wind pushes against the sails, and the sails push against the wind, causing the boat to move forward.\r\n\r\nImagine you are standing in a field, holding a big piece of cloth. If you hold the cloth out in front of you and the wind blows against it, the cloth will billow and fill with air. Now, if you tilt the cloth at a slight angle, the wind will still be able to blow against it, but it will also push the cloth (and you) forward.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to how a sailboat's sails work. The sail is held out at an angle, and the wind blows against it, causing the boat to move forward. The sailor can adjust the angle of the sail to make the boat go faster or slower, or to turn in different directions.\r\n\r\nI hope that helps! Do you have any other questions about sailboats or how they work?<>Sure! A sailboat is able to sail into the wind because of the shape and angle of its sails.
