What causes breathlessness during nights?I am constantly out of breath. Just getting into bed makes me out of breath. I cant do anything without feeling this way. I also have no motivation. I was diagnosed with two blocked arteries while I was in the service but they said two veins took their place, or something like that. I am 44 yrs old and that happened about 6 yrs ago.
Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. You are having breathlessness in night (supine position). This is known as orthopnea. And it is characteristic feature of congestive heart failure (CHF). You are also having two blocked coronary arteries. So possibility of CHF is high in your case. So better to consult cardiologist and get done 1. Blood pressure monitoring 2. Ecg 3. 2d echo 4. Stress test (trade mill test) 5. Repeat coronary angiography (if required). You will need diuretics and other cardiac supportive drugs. So don't wait at home, consult cardiologist and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.
Breathlessness during the night can be caused by a variety of factors. Some possible causes include:\n\nAsthma: Asthma is a chronic lung condition that can cause difficulty breathing, especially at night.\n\nHeart problems: If you have a history of heart problems, such as blocked arteries, you may be more prone to breathlessness during the night.\n\nObstructive sleep apnea: This condition occurs when your airway becomes partially or completely blocked during sleep, causing you to wake up frequently to gasp for air.\n\nAllergies: Allergies can cause congestion and inflammation in the airways, leading to difficulty breathing.\n\nAnemia: Anemia is a condition in which you have a low red blood cell count. Red blood cells carry oxygen to the body's tissues, so if you have anemia, you may feel out of breath.\n\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): COPD is a group of lung conditions that can cause difficulty breathing, especially during physical activity.\n\nIt's important to speak with your doctor about your symptoms to determine the cause and receive proper treatment. In the meantime, try to get as much rest as possible and avoid activities that may make your breathlessness worse.
