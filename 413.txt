why does the French presidential election matter so much to the world ? It 's all over the news in Europe and UK . Explain like I'm five. <>Because one of the candidates ( Marine Le Pen ) is running on a right - wing populist anti - immigration platform very much like Donald Trump in the US and in common with many who voted for Brexit in the UK . If she gets in then : * it suggests that this move to the right is a western phenomenon affecting an increasing number of countries and not just the US \/ UK * it will see the start of France 's push to leave the EU just as the UK has done . If that happens , the future of the EU ( with two of its three core countries missing ) will be very uncertain .<>The French presidential election is important because France is a major country in Europe and the world. It is a founding member of the European Union and plays a significant role in international relations. The president of France is responsible for representing the country on the global stage and making decisions that affect the lives of French citizens and the direction of the country. The election process is democratic, which means that the French people get to choose who they want to be their leader. This is important because it allows the people to have a say in how their country is run and helps ensure that their needs and values are represented in government. The French presidential election is therefore of interest to people around the world because it has the potential to impact not only France, but also the broader region of Europe and beyond.<>reddit_eli5
