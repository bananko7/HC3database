The Concept of Revenge My 9 year old brother just asked what \" Revenge \" was . How can I explain it to him ? Explain like I'm five.<>You steal my toy , the world is n't fair and balanced again until I do something of equal or greater significance to you . That 's the easiest way to describe it I 'd say . But the reason it 's not simply justice is because it 's usually blown out of proportion . For more serious examples , let 's say you murder my innocent father in cold blood . You get locked up in jail , but I feel like justice has n't been served . My solution ? Kill YOUR innocent father , or another family member . They did n't do anything , but I brought pain to you . So I feel satisfied , but I 've not only done something wrong but now YOU feel like you need to settle things with ME again .<>Revenge is when someone does something bad to someone else on purpose, and then that person does something bad back to the first person in order to get back at them. It's like when someone takes your toy without asking, and then you take one of their toys without asking. It's a way of trying to make the other person feel bad or hurt in the same way that they made you feel bad or hurt. But it's not a good way to solve problems, because it can often lead to more fighting and hurt feelings. It's usually better to try to talk to the person and try to understand why they did what they did, and then find a way to solve the problem without hurting each other.<>reddit_eli5
