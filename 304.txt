The answer to the 100 monk riddle Riddle and solution explained here : URL_0 Explain like I'm five.<>I thought these monks were supposed to be highly logical . If that were true , after hearing what the doctor had said , they simply would n't look at anyone else 's forehead , ever . They would then never know they had the disease and then they 'd never die from it .<>Sure! Here is the solution to the \"100 monks riddle\" explained in a way that a five-year-old might understand:\n\nThere are 100 monks on an island. They all follow a set of rules that they must always follow. One of the rules is that they must always tell the truth, and another rule is that they must never lie.\n\nOne day, the monks had a problem. They needed to get a heavy stone across a bridge, but the bridge was too weak to support the weight of the stone. They had to figure out a way to get the stone across the bridge without breaking it.\n\nThe monks came up with a plan. They would all stand on the bridge and pass the stone from one monk to the next until it reached the other side. But there was a catch - only the monk who was holding the stone was allowed to speak.\n\nThe monks started passing the stone from one to the next, and as they did, they all followed the rules and only spoke the truth. But as they got closer to the other side, one of the monks realized that there was a way to trick the others.\n\nThe monk holding the stone knew that the other monks would always follow the rules and only speak the truth. So, he decided to ask a question that would allow him to figure out who was next in line to receive the stone.\n\nHe asked, \"Will the next monk who receives the stone be wearing a red robe?\" The monk who was next in line knew that he was wearing a red robe, so he had to answer \"yes.\" But this answer broke the rule that the monks must always tell the truth.\n\nThe monks were confused by this answer, and they had to figure out what was going on. They realized that the monk holding the stone had tricked them by asking a question that broke the rule of always telling the truth.\n\nIn the end, the monks were able to solve the problem and get the stone across the bridge without breaking it. And they learned an important lesson about always following the rules and being careful with the questions they ask.<>reddit_eli5
