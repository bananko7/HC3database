Why do n't energy drink companies use any other legal and safe stimulants apart from caffeine ? Examples : Ephedrine and Modafinil Please explain like I'm five.<>Because caffeine is more addictive cheaper and safer in larger quantaties<>Energy drink companies use caffeine because it is a legal and safe stimulant that is widely available and has been extensively studied. Caffeine is a stimulant that can help to increase alertness and improve mental and physical performance. It is also relatively inexpensive to obtain and use in energy drinks. \nEphedrine is a stimulant that is similar to caffeine, but it is not as widely available and is not as well-studied. It has also been linked to some potential negative side effects, such as increased heart rate and blood pressure, and it is not legal for use in dietary supplements in many countries. \nModafinil is a prescription medication that is used to treat narcolepsy, a condition that causes excessive daytime sleepiness. It is not typically used in energy drinks because it is a prescription medication and is not legal to sell or use without a prescription. \nIn summary, energy drink companies use caffeine because it is a legal and safe stimulant that is widely available and has been extensively studied, while other stimulants like ephedrine and modafinil may not be as widely available or have as much research to support their use, and may also have potential negative side effects or be subject to legal restrictions.<>reddit_eli5
