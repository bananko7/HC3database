When a person is born deaf , what language do they think in ? I know they eventually learn how to read and understand other human beings , but what happens until then \/ what would happen if they simply never did ? Explain like I'm five.
To elaborate even further on the first two responses . People think in pictures , mental images . We do n't begin to assign words to those images until we learn language . People also have basic needs such as food and water . In that case we are not thinking in images but rather based on instinct . We then assign words to those needs .
When a person is born deaf, they do not automatically think in any specific language. Language is a system of communication that is learned through social interaction and exposure to spoken or written language. Deaf individuals who are born into deaf families or communities where sign language is the primary mode of communication may learn to think in sign language from an early age, just as hearing individuals may learn to think in a spoken language like English or Spanish.\r\n\r\nIf a deaf individual does not have access to sign language or other forms of communication, they may still be able to think and understand the world around them, but they may have difficulty expressing their thoughts and ideas to others. There are many ways that deaf individuals can communicate, such as through written language, gestures, or facial expressions, but these methods are not as rich or efficient as a fully developed language like sign language.\r\n\r\nIt is important for deaf individuals to have access to language and communication in order to fully develop their cognitive and social skills and participate fully in society. Without language, a person's ability to think and understand may be limited.
