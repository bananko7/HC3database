How is RedBox in business ? Why is it that u can ' rent ' a movie from nearly anything connected to the internet and blockbusters closing up shop everywhere yet there is a 20 min line at a redbox kiosk at the grocery store ? Explain like I'm five.<>Because what costs me $ 1.28 at Redbox costs me $ 3.99 ( at least ) On Demand or Amazon .<>Redbox is a company that rents movies and video games through automated kiosks that are located in various places, such as grocery stores and gas stations. These kiosks contain DVDs and video games that people can rent for a low price.\n\nOne reason that Redbox is still in business is because they offer a convenient way for people to rent movies and games. Many people prefer to rent from a kiosk rather than streaming a movie online or going to a store, because it is quick and easy. Redbox kiosks are also located in many places that are convenient for people to access, such as in grocery stores and gas stations.\n\nAnother reason that Redbox is still in business is because they offer a cheaper alternative to other ways of renting movies and games. Many people are looking for ways to save money, and renting from Redbox is often less expensive than streaming a movie online or renting from a traditional video rental store.\n\nOverall, Redbox is able to stay in business because they offer a convenient and affordable way for people to rent movies and games, which is something that many people are still interested in doing.<>reddit_eli5
