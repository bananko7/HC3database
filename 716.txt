What happened to Digg . I 'm pretty \" new \" to the social internet ( Reddit , Facebook , Twitter ) . I keep seeing refrences to Digg failing and things like that . Explain like I'm five.<>Digg was a site very much like Reddit , but with only 8 \" subreddits \" , and the source was closed . A number of so - called \" power users \" were increasingly criticized for gaming the systems , and eventually the owners themselves \" sold - out \" by allowing companies to automatically submit stories , which would then be gamed . About the same time they also went through an interface change , going from fairly - bad to downright - terrible to look at . So everyone left , and one of the compeditors , Reddit , won out .<>Digg was a social news website that allowed users to submit and vote on news stories and other content. It was popular in the mid-2000s but eventually lost popularity to other social media sites like Reddit and Facebook. Digg was purchased by Betaworks in 2012 and relaunched as a different type of site, but it never regained the popularity it once had.<>reddit_eli5
