What is the difference between a scrip dividend and a stock split?<>Most corporations have a limit on the number of shares that they can issue, which is written into their corporate charter.  They usually sell a number that is fewer than the maximum authorized number so that they have a reserve for secondary offerings, employee incentives, etc. In a scrip dividend, the company is distributing authorized shares that were not previously issued.  This reduces the number of shares that it has to sell in the future to raise capital, so it reduces the assets of the company. In a split, every share (including the authorized shares that haven't been distributed) are divided.  This results in more total shares (which then trade at a price that's roughly proportional to the split), but it does not reduce the assets of the company.<>A scrip dividend is a type of dividend payment in which the company provides shareholders with the option to receive additional shares of stock or cash instead of a cash dividend. This can be attractive to shareholders who want to increase their ownership in the company, or who want to reinvest their dividends rather than receive cash.On the other hand, a stock split is a corporate action in which a company increases the number of outstanding shares of its stock by issuing more shares to current shareholders. This has the effect of decreasing the value of each individual share, but increasing the total number of shares owned by each shareholder. A stock split does not change the overall value of a shareholder's investment in the company, but it can make the shares more affordable and more liquid, which can make the stock more attractive to investors.In summary, a scrip dividend gives shareholders the option to receive additional shares or cash, while a stock split increases the number of outstanding shares and decreases the value of each individual share.<>finance
