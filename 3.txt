Why do electronics need to reset for updates to take effect ? I do not think this applies to all electronics , but as far as my computers , and gaming consoles go , it seems to hold true . Explain like I'm five.<>It does not apply for all operating systems . Linux , as an example , only asks to reboot after a kernel update .<>When you update the software on an electronic device, you are essentially making changes to the instructions that the device follows in order to perform its various tasks. In order for these changes to take effect, the device needs to be restarted so that it can begin following the updated instructions.\n\nThink of it like a recipe for making a cake. The recipe is a set of instructions that tell you what ingredients to use and how to mix them together to make a cake. If you want to change the recipe, you need to update the instructions by adding or removing certain ingredients. In order to follow the updated recipe, you need to start from the beginning and follow all of the new instructions.\n\nIn the same way, when you update the software on an electronic device, you are making changes to the instructions that the device follows. In order for these changes to take effect, the device needs to be restarted so that it can begin following the updated instructions.<>reddit_eli5
