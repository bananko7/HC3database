Why are missing \/ unknown textures in video games often replaced with a black and purple checkered texture ? Talking about [ THIS texture ] ( URL_0 ) . Please explain like I'm five.<>The really hot magenta used to stand in for textures is so that its very easy to see when a texture is not present . Its a color you are going to rarely ever actually have in the game so if you see it in the game you know something has gone wrong . Checkering further helps this .<>This texture is often used as a placeholder in video games when the final texture is not yet available or when there is a problem with loading the texture. The black and purple checkered pattern is used because it is easy to see and it is clear that something is supposed to be there, but it is not yet finished or is not working properly. It is like when you see a construction site and there is a big sign that says \"coming soon\" or \"under construction\". The black and purple checkered pattern is a way for the game developers to say \"this part is not done yet\" or \"something is wrong with this part\".<>reddit_eli5
