Why do dogs want to play fetch , but never let go of the ball ? I 've wondered this since I 've had my golden retriever , who 's almost 10 . Please explain like I'm five.<>They want to play ' chase the ball ' * and * play ' fight for the ball ' . It 's like sex with your gf . She might assume that you just want to play ' fondle the tits ' , but you really want to play ' fondle the tits ' * and * ' hide the salami ' . edit : please tell me this is n't actually being asked by a five year old .<>Dogs love to play fetch because it's a fun game that allows them to use their natural instincts to chase and retrieve things. When a dog brings the ball back to you and drops it at your feet, it's their way of saying \"I caught it, now it's your turn to throw it again!\" Dogs may not want to let go of the ball because they are having so much fun playing the game and don't want it to end. It can also be because they are very excited and just want to keep the fun going.<>reddit_eli5
