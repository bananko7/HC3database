Definition of equity<>The word equity always refers to the ownership of something, whether it be a company or a home. The wikipedia article is differentiating companies by how they raised money for operations. Equity companies, by their definition are those that sold an interest in the company in exchange for capital. Debt based companies, again by their definition, are those that borrow money from investors, but instead of an ownership stake they promise to pay back the money presumably with interest.<>Equity refers to the ownership interest in a company. It represents the residual value that would be left over for shareholders if all of a company's debts were paid off. In other words, equity is the value of the company that is owned by the shareholders. This can be represented in the form of stock or shares in the company. Equity can also refer to the difference between the value of an asset, such as a home, and any debts or liabilities associated with that asset. For example, if you own a home worth $500,000 and you have a mortgage balance of $400,000, your equity in the home would be $100,000.<>finance
