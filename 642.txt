Stocks vs Bonds ? What is \/ are the difference \/ s ? Explain like I'm five.<>Stock is * equity * , Bonds are * debt * . When you buy a share of stock , you are buying a piece of that company . When people talk about own X% of a company , they are discussing equity and stock . Stock is about revenue and growth , the future in other words . Your value and profit will come from selling the stock to someone else , or the dividends ( shares of revenue ) that the company pays to its owners . When you buy a bond , you 're really just lending a company money ... sorta . If you buy the bond FROM the company then you are just loaning them money that they pay you back plus interest over X amount of time . But bonds are also bought and sold on secondary markets , at which point you are just swapping ' who owns the debt ' .<>\\nSure! Stocks and bonds are both types of investments that people can use to save and grow their money. Here's how they're different:\\n\\nStocks: When you buy a stock, you're basically buying a small piece of ownership in a company. If the company does well, the value of the stock might go up, and you can sell it for a profit. But if the company doesn't do well, the value of the stock might go down, and you could lose money.\\n\\nBonds: When you buy a bond, you're lending money to a company or government. In return, they agree to pay you back the money you lent, plus interest, at a later date. Bonds are usually considered to be less risky than stocks because they typically pay a fixed amount of interest. But they also usually don't have the potential to make as much money as stocks.\\n\\nSo, to sum it up: stocks are ownership in a company, while bonds are loans to a company or government. Stocks can be riskier, but they also have the potential to make more money. Bonds are generally less risky, but they also usually don't make as much money.<>reddit_eli5
