Explain like I'm five.<>They are n't bad for your body , even if you habitually use them .<>Sugar substitutes are substances that are used to sweeten food and drinks, but they do not provide the same nutrients as sugar. They are often used by people who are trying to reduce their sugar intake or manage their blood sugar levels, such as people with diabetes.\n\nThere are several different types of sugar substitutes, including Splenda, Equal, Sucralose, Saccharin, and Sweet n' Low. These sugar substitutes are typically made from chemicals, and they are many times sweeter than sugar.\n\nThere is some debate about whether or not sugar substitutes are safe for habitual use. Some studies have suggested that they may be associated with certain health risks, such as an increased risk of cancer or changes in gut bacteria. However, other studies have not found these risks.\n\nIt is also important to note that sugar substitutes are not a replacement for a healthy diet and lifestyle. They should not be used as a way to compensate for an unhealthy diet or to try to lose weight. Instead, it is important to focus on eating a variety of nutritious foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins, and to engage in regular physical activity.\n\nIt is not clear if one type of sugar substitute is better than another. It is important to speak with a healthcare provider or a registered dietitian if you are considering using a sugar substitute, as they can help you understand the potential risks and benefits and determine if a sugar substitute is right for you.<>reddit_eli5
