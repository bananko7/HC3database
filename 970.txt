Why do n't we distill water for drinking ? would n't it be a lot more pure than spring or filtered ? we get minerals out of water that would be taken out when distilled , but we could get them from other sources such as food . Please explain like I'm five.<>Distilling water takes a lot of energy for a marginal benefit .<>Water that has been distilled has had all of its impurities and minerals removed through a process of boiling and condensation. While this can make the water more pure, it can also make it less healthy to drink because it lacks the minerals that are naturally found in water. These minerals, such as calcium and magnesium, are important for our bodies to function properly and can be obtained through the foods we eat. In addition, distilled water can taste flat or boring because it lacks the minerals that give water its natural taste. It's important to note that while distilled water is pure, it is not necessarily the best choice for drinking water. Instead, it is often used in certain industrial and medical settings where very pure water is required. In general, it is recommended to drink water that has been treated to remove harmful contaminants, such as bacteria and viruses, but still contains some of the natural minerals found in water. This can be achieved through methods such as filtration or reverse osmosis.<>reddit_eli5
