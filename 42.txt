If \" calories in < calories out = weight loss , \" how can certain medications cause weight gain or weight loss ? Additional question : What role does insulin resistance play in calorie intake or output ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Medications that cause weight gain \/ loss are often screwing with your metabolism . Say your car gets 20mpg and you are going on a 100 mile trip . You put 5 gallons in it and you 're good . Now say you add a fuel additive that makes your car get 25mpg , or 15mpg . Now if you add the same 5 gallons for your hundred mile trip you will either have fuel left over or run out . Some medications also affect appetite . Now you still need 5 gallons for your 100 mile trip , but you only feel like putting in 3 , or maybe now you want 7 . In your body , less fuel than you need causes weight loss and more than you need causes gain .<>Certainly! When you eat food, your body uses the calories from that food to fuel your body's functions. If you eat more calories than your body needs, the excess calories will be stored in your body as fat. This is why eating more calories than you burn can cause you to gain weight.On the other hand, if you burn more calories than you eat, your body will use the stored fat as energy, which can cause you to lose weight.Now, certain medications can interfere with this process and cause you to gain or lose weight. For example, some medications can increase your appetite, which can cause you to eat more calories and gain weight. Other medications can affect your metabolism, which is the process by which your body burns calories, and can either increase or decrease the number of calories your body burns.Insulin resistance is when your body has trouble using the hormone insulin to process sugar in your blood. This can lead to high blood sugar levels, which can increase your risk of developing diabetes. Insulin resistance can also affect your weight, as high levels of insulin in your body can cause your body to store more fat, which can lead to weight gain. On the other hand, if you are able to improve your insulin resistance and better control your blood sugar levels, you may be able to lose weight.<>reddit_eli5
