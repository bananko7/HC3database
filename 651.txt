why do some authors write books using a pseudonym ? I just saw that JK Rowling wrote a new crime fiction novel , called The Cuckoo 's Calling , under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith . Why do authors do this ? Explain like I'm five.<>Some writers want their current work to be honestly judged without having their name or their previous works influencing people 's opinions . This is the case with JK Rowling .<>There are several reasons why an author might choose to write a book under a pseudonym, or pen name. One reason might be to separate their different types of writing. For example, an author might use a pseudonym if they write in multiple genres, and they want to make it clear to readers that the book they are publishing under that name is different from their other work. Another reason might be to protect their privacy. Some authors prefer to keep their personal lives private, and using a pseudonym can help them do that. It can also help them avoid being judged based on their real identity, especially if they are writing about controversial subjects. Finally, some authors use a pseudonym simply because they prefer a different name and think it sounds better for the type of book they are writing. Whatever the reason, using a pseudonym can be a way for an author to try something new or explore a different aspect of their writing without being tied to their real name.<>reddit_eli5
