Why did countries and empires need gold and money for war . Ca n't a king or leader have just taken what he needed ? I know why we need money today for war , but why back then . Please explain like I'm five.<>Because even in an absolute monarchy , things are n't free . You can take a sword . If you need more swords , though , you need the blacksmith to make them . He 'll need money . Oh , and the blacksmith needs iron . Sure , your soldiers can take the mine ( with their one sword , I guess ) but you need miners to get it out . They need money . And someone has to transport the iron ... and so on .<>In the past, countries and empires needed gold and money for war for a few reasons. First, gold and money were used to pay for supplies and equipment that were needed for the war. This might include things like food, weapons, and uniforms for soldiers. Second, gold and money were used to pay soldiers and other people who worked for the military. This included people like blacksmiths, doctors, and carpenters, as well as soldiers themselves. Third, gold and money were often used to bribe other countries or groups to join the war on a particular side, or to stop fighting against them. Finally, gold and money were often used as a symbol of power and wealth. A country or empire that had a lot of gold or money was seen as being strong and successful, which could make other countries more likely to follow their lead or agree to their demands. While a king or leader might have been able to take what he needed by force, this could often lead to conflict and resistance. Using gold and money allowed countries and empires to get what they needed in a more peaceful and orderly way.<>reddit_eli5
