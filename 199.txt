If there are an innumerable amount of stars in the universe , why is n't our sky bright all the time ? Why do n't all the other stars from different galaxies fill up the black space between the stars we can see ? Please explain like I'm five.<>This is known as [ Olber 's Paradox ] ( URL_0 ) . Because the universe , so far as we know , contains an infinite number of stars , we should find that , whichever direction we look in , we see a star . But this does n't reflect what we know about the night sky . There are billions of stars , but there are very large black areas between the stars , too . The most common answer to the paradox is that , although it 's true that there ought to be a star in any direction we look , it is n't always true that this star will be in the * visible * universe . The * visible universe * is that bit of universe which is close enough to us that the light from it has had enough time , since the start of time , to have reached us already .<>Even though there are a very large number of stars in the universe, most of them are very far away from Earth. This means that they are too faint for us to see from our planet. The stars that we can see with the naked eye are only the ones that are relatively close to us. \nThe black space that we see between the stars is actually empty space. It's called \"dark\" space because there are no stars or other bright objects in it to give off light. \nThink about it this way: if you were standing in a field at night and you had a flashlight, you would be able to see the area around you because the light from the flashlight illuminates the ground and objects nearby. But if you turned off the flashlight, everything beyond the reach of the light would become dark and invisible to you. Similarly, we can only see the stars that are close enough to us and bright enough to be seen from Earth, even though there are many more stars beyond our line of sight.<>reddit_eli5
