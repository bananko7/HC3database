How does water conduct electricity if neither hydrogen or oxygen are conductive ? I touched a slightly damp iPad charger and got a bit of a jolt the other day , and this was the first thing that came to mind . Please explain like I'm five.<>Water itself is actually an insulator . Its the impurities in the water that can conduct electricity .<>Water can conduct electricity because it contains ions, which are atoms that have gained or lost electrons and have a positive or negative charge. When water contains a lot of dissolved minerals, it can conduct electricity because the ions in the minerals allow electricity to flow through the water. \nHowever, pure water does not conduct electricity very well because it does not have many ions. This is because the hydrogen atoms in water are bonded to the oxygen atoms through covalent bonds, which do not allow electrons to flow freely. As a result, pure water is a very poor conductor of electricity. \nSo, when you touched a slightly damp iPad charger, the water on your skin may have conducted electricity, which is why you got a bit of a jolt. But if the water on your skin was pure, you probably would not have felt anything.<>reddit_eli5
