Sleep paralysis and why it happens . I also heard that it is a form of lucid dream \/ can become one . Is that true ? Explain like I'm five.<>When you fall asleep , your brain does n't completely turn off . In order to prevent you from acting out your dreams \/ thoughts while you sleep , the brain releases chemicals that suppress motor control , leaving you unable to move . This inhibition is supposed to be lifted as soon as you wake up , but sometimes it does n't and that 's when you get sleep paralysis . The opposite , no inhibition while asleep , is what causes sleep walking . As to its ' connection to lucid dreaming , I have n't read anything about that . Sleep paralysis is most often caused by disrupted REM sleep ( i.e. dream state ) , so some people may believe they are still dreaming when in fact they are awake .<>Sleep paralysis is a condition that can occur when you are falling asleep or waking up. During sleep, your body is paralyzed, which helps to keep you from acting out your dreams. Sleep paralysis happens when this paralysis persists after you wake up, making it difficult or impossible for you to move your body or speak.\r\n\r\nSometimes people who experience sleep paralysis may also have vivid, dream-like experiences. These experiences can be vivid and lifelike, and people may feel like they are dreaming while they are awake. Some people may even feel like they are experiencing a lucid dream, which is a type of dream where you are aware that you are dreaming and can sometimes control what happens in the dream.\r\n\r\nIt's not entirely clear why sleep paralysis happens, but it is thought to be related to problems with the way the body's sleep-wake cycle is regulated. Some people may be more prone to sleep paralysis due to certain factors such as sleep deprivation, irregular sleep schedules, or certain medications. It can also be triggered by other conditions such as narcolepsy, a disorder that affects the way the body regulates sleep.\r\n\r\nIn general, sleep paralysis is not a serious condition and does not cause any long-term harm. However, it can be unsettling and may cause anxiety for some people. If you are experiencing sleep paralysis and it is affecting your quality of life, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider. They can help you determine the cause of your sleep paralysis and suggest ways to manage it.<>reddit_eli5
