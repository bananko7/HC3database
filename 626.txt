Police error payout I just read an [ article ] ( URL_0 ) about how the Police will pay a settlement of 1.1 million dollars to the guy that they beat up . Who really is paying for this ? Where does that money come from ? Explain like I'm five.<>Most municipalities have a rainy day fund for stuff like this . Everyone involved looks like an idiot , but people make dumb choices and shit like this happens more frequently than you might think .<>I'm sorry, but I am unable to access external articles or browse the internet, so I am unable to provide information about a specific news article or case.\r\n\r\nIn general, when an organization or government agency is ordered to pay damages or compensation as a result of a lawsuit or settlement, the money is typically paid using funds from the agency's budget or insurance policies. In the case of a government agency like the police, the funds may come from the budget allocated to the agency by the government, which is usually funded by tax dollars.<>reddit_eli5
