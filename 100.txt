If carbon is lighter than oxygen why ca n't carbon float in air ? This actually seems like a really stupid question to ask but I 'm just curious as to if or why it ca n't happen Explain like I'm five. <>A single carbon atom may be lighter than a single oxygen molecule , but a chunk of carbon is far denser and more tightly packed than air .<>Carbon is indeed lighter than oxygen, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it can float in air. In order for an object to float in air, it needs to be less dense than the air around it. Density is a measure of how much matter is packed into a certain amount of space.\\n\\nIf an object is denser than the air around it, it will sink because it is heavier. If an object is less dense than the air around it, it will float because it is lighter.\\n\\nEven though carbon is lighter than oxygen, it is still denser than air. That's why it doesn't float in air. It's like a rock that is lighter than a feather, but it still sinks to the bottom of a pool because it is denser than the water.\\n\\nI hope that helps to clarify things! Let me know if you have any other questions.<>Carbon is indeed lighter than oxygen, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it can float in air.
