What will happen when a bid price is higher than an ask price?
The situation you're proposing is an over-simplification that wouldn't occur in practice. Orders occur in a sequence over time. Time is an important part of the order matching process. Orders are not processed in parallel; otherwise, the problem of fairness, already heavily regulated, would become even more complex. First, crossed and locked markets are forbidden by regulators.  Crossed orders are where one exchange has a higher bid than another's ask, or a lower ask than another's bid.  A locked market is where a bid on one exchange is equal to the ask on another.  HFTs would be able to make these markets because of the gap between exchange fees. Since these are forbidden, and handling orders in parallel would ensure that a crossed or locked market would occur, orders are serialized (queued up), processed in order of price-time priority. So, the first to cross the market will be filled with the best oldest opposing order. Regulators believe crossed or locked markets are unfair.  They would however eliminate the bid ask spread for many large securities thus the bid-ask cost to the holder.
If a bid price is higher than the ask price, it means that there is a discrepancy in the prices being quoted for a particular asset. This can occur for a variety of reasons, such as a misunderstanding of the market value of the asset, an error in the quoted prices, or a change in market conditions.In most cases, this discrepancy will be resolved quickly as market participants adjust their quotes to reflect the true market value of the asset. However, if the discrepancy persists for an extended period of time, it could indicate that there is a lack of liquidity in the market for the asset.
