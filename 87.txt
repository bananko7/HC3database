Why do malls and businesses not have peaked roofs like you see on houses ? I remember hearing about a store collapsing from too much snow collecting on the roof . Is there a reason not to have a peaked roof to prevent this ? Explain like I'm five.<>Flat roofing is cheaper to build , is accessible ( you can go up on it and do stuff up there more easily , including maintenance and are unlikely to fall ) , and you can add another floor more easily if you want to . Providing you have a decent membrane on there and it does n't need much maintenance , it will be cheaper in the longer run than a pitched roof , and gives you more options .<>Malls and businesses often don't have peaked roofs because peaked roofs are more expensive to build than flat roofs. Flat roofs are easier to construct and require less materials, so they are less expensive to build. Flat roofs are also easier to maintain because they don't have as many parts that need to be checked and repaired.\n\nPeaked roofs can be more prone to problems like collapsing under the weight of heavy snow because they have a steeper slope, which means that the snow can pile up more easily. Flat roofs are less likely to have this problem because the snow doesn't have as far to slide before it falls off the edge of the roof. However, flat roofs can still have problems if they are not built or maintained properly, so it's important for businesses to make sure their roofs are in good condition.\n\nIn general, the choice of whether to use a peaked roof or a flat roof for a building is based on a combination of factors, including the cost of construction, the climate where the building is located, and the specific needs of the building.<>reddit_eli5
