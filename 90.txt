What one bit of financial advice do you wish you could've given yourself five years ago?<>When I was contracting I wish I had joined a tax efficient umbrella organisation rather than just work as a sole trader. I also wish I had put money aside to pay my taxes rather than just spend it all. :(<>One bit of financial advice that I wish I could have given myself five years ago is to start saving and investing as early as possible. The earlier you start saving and investing, the more time your money has to grow and compound, which can result in significant long-term wealth accumulation. Additionally, it's important to set financial goals and make a plan to achieve them, as this can help you make informed decisions about your money and stay on track towards reaching your objectives. It's also a good idea to regularly review and adjust your financial plan to ensure that it remains relevant and aligned with your changing needs and circumstances.<>finance
