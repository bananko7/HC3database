Why are venomous mammals and birds so rare in comparison to reptiles and fish ? Venomous species are hard to find in mammals , even more so among birds . What 's the deal with all these venomous snakes , lizards , and fish ? Explain like I'm five.<>sadly this is something that an ELI5 probably ca n't answer because it 's something not a lot biologists have a good answer for . some suspect it 's because claws and teeth are just much faster easier way of killing things course then the question is why do n't insects , fish , and snakes use their teeth and claws more . it may well be that the evolutionary line which produced placental mammals just happened to not be amongst the reptiles which have venom relegating it to marsupials and those with errant mutations in their digestive enzymes . but there really is n't a lot of good information on why venom is so rare in mammals .<>Well, there are many more species of reptiles and fish in the world than there are mammals and birds, so it makes sense that there would be more venomous reptiles and fish than there are venomous mammals and birds. Venomous animals are animals that have a special kind of poison in their bodies that they can use to protect themselves from predators or to catch prey. Reptiles and fish have been around for a very long time, and they have had a lot of time to evolve different ways of protecting themselves and catching food. That's why there are so many venomous reptiles and fish. Mammals and birds are relatively new compared to reptiles and fish, so they haven't had as much time to evolve different ways of protecting themselves and catching food. That's why there aren't as many venomous mammals and birds.<>reddit_eli5
