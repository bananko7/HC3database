Why is it easier and more natural to extend my mouth to the left side when I smile for reference I mean a smile similar to the one on the scumbag stacy pic . Explain like I'm five.<>I really hope this gets answered because I just spent 5 minutes smiling to myself on both sides of my face .<>It's easier and more natural to extend your mouth to the left side when you smile because that's how our muscles are arranged. We have muscles in our face that allow us to move our mouth in different directions, and some of these muscles are stronger or more dominant than others. When you smile, certain muscles in your face contract, or get shorter and tighter, and this causes your mouth to turn up at the corners. The muscles that cause your mouth to turn up on the left side may be stronger or more dominant than the ones on the right, which is why it feels easier and more natural to extend your mouth to the left when you smile.<>reddit_eli5
