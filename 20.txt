Had spinal fusion. Pain after work, while standing. Has high Bp. Is inversion table advisable.hello dr , my husband had spinal fusion 13 years ago and still gets some pain after working all day or sometimes just standing for to long can cause him pain , he is a large man 6.2 feet tall and aprox 140 kilos weight. my question is can he use an inversion table, without hurting himself further? he also has high blood pressure.<>Hello, I have studied your case.I will advise you to do MRI spine to see for any disc bulge or spinal canal stenosis.And also check your vit B12 and vit D3 level.Medication like methylcobalamine and analgesic will reduce pain.You can continue yoga exercises and focus on spine extension exercises.I do not recommend inversion table and probably no doctor will recommend it.Some exercises which can be done include- Spine extension exercises, Lying on your stomach flat lift leg 6 inches from ground, do it for other leg.Now lift both hand and leg simultaneously, 6 inch off the ground and stayPosition for around 10 breathes. Core stabilizing spine exercises will help.You may consult physiotherapist for guidance. He may start TENS, or ultrasound which is helpful in your case.If not relieved you can take epidural injection.Hope this helps. Wish you a speedy recovery.
