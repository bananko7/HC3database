There are no negative physical effects -- there are rumors that LSD remains in your spinal fluid forever , but this is false . Your pupils become dilated , so if you are day tripping , you should wear sun glasses . The only risk is having a bad trip , but this can be avoided by doing the drug in a comfortable place with people that you trust . LSD can trigger a psychotic episode in those with , or who will develop , schizophrenia . For the most part it is a very safe drug as long as you are being responsible and have done your research .
LSD, also known as lysergic acid diethylamide, is a powerful psychoactive substance that can produce a wide range of effects, including altered thinking, perception, and mood. It can also produce a range of physical effects, including dilated pupils, increased body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure, as well as tremors and loss of appetite.\n\nOne of the main negative effects of LSD is that it can produce \"bad trips,\" which are intense and often unpleasant experiences that can include feelings of fear, panic, and paranoia. These bad trips can be very distressing and can lead to long-term psychological problems in some people.\n\nAnother negative effect of LSD is that it can interfere with a person's ability to make good decisions or think clearly. This can lead to accidents or risky behaviors while under the influence of the drug.\n\nIt's important to note that the effects of LSD can vary widely from person to person, and the potential for negative effects increases when the drug is taken in high doses or combined with other substances.\n\nIt's also important to remember that LSD is illegal in many countries and is classified as a controlled substance. This means that it is illegal to produce, sell, or use the drug. Using LSD can also have legal consequences, even if it is for personal use.
