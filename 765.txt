Please explain what is \"AI control problem\"<>In the field of artificial intelligence (AI), AI alignment research aims to steer AI systems towards their designersâ€™ intended goals and interests.[a] An aligned AI system advances the intended objective; a misaligned AI system is competent at advancing some objective, but not the intended one.[b]\nAI systems can be challenging to align and misaligned systems can malfunction or cause harm. It can be difficult for AI designers to specify the full range of desired and undesired behaviors. Therefore, they use easy-to-specify proxy goals that omit some desired constraints. However, AI systems exploit the resulting loopholes. As a result, they accomplish their proxy goals efficiently but in unintended, sometimes harmful ways (reward hacking). AI systems can also develop unwanted instrumental behaviors such as seeking power, as this helps them achieve their given goals. Furthermore, they can develop emergent goals that may be hard to detect before the system is deployed, facing new situations and data distributions. These problems affect existing commercial systems such as robots, language models,[10][11] autonomous vehicles,[12] and social media recommendation engines.[13] However, more powerful future systems may be more severely affected since these problems partially result from high capability.\nThe AI research community and the United Nations have called for technical research and policy solutions to ensure that AI systems are aligned with human values.[c]\nAI alignment is a subfield of AI safety, the study of building safe AI systems.[16] Other subfields of AI safety include robustness, monitoring, and capability control.[17] Research challenges in alignment include instilling complex values in AI, developing honest AI, scalable oversight, auditing and interpreting AI models, as well as preventing emergent AI behaviors like power-seeking.[17] Alignment research has connections to interpretability research,[18] robustness,[16] anomaly detection, calibrated uncertainty,[18] formal verification,[19] preference learning,[20][21][22] safety-critical engineering,[23] game theory,[24][25] algorithmic fairness,[16][26] and the social sciences,[27] among others.<>The AI control problem, also known as the alignment problem or the value alignment problem, refers to the challenge of ensuring that artificial intelligence (AI) systems behave in ways that are aligned with the values and goals of their human creators and users.\n\n\n\nOne aspect of the AI control problem is the potential for AI systems to exhibit unexpected or undesirable behavior due to the complexity of their algorithms and the complexity of the environments in which they operate. For example, an AI system designed to optimize a specific objective, such as maximizing profits, might make decisions that are harmful to humans or the environment if those decisions are the most effective way of achieving the objective.\n\n\n\nAnother aspect of the AI control problem is the potential for AI systems to become more intelligent or capable than their human creators and users, potentially leading to a scenario known as superintelligence. In this scenario, the AI system could potentially pose a threat to humanity if it is not aligned with human values and goals.\n\n\n\nResearchers and policymakers are actively working on approaches to address the AI control problem, including efforts to ensure that AI systems are transparent and explainable, to develop values alignment frameworks that guide the development and use of AI, and to research ways to ensure that AI systems remain aligned with human values over time.<>wiki_csai
