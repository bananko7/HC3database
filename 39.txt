Please explain what is \"Operational definition\"<>An operational definition specifies concrete, replicable procedures designed to represent a construct. In the words of American psychologist S.S. Stevens (1935), \"An operation is the performance which we execute in order to make known a concept.\" For example, an operational definition of \"fear\" (the construct) often includes measurable physiologic responses that occur in response to a perceived threat. Thus, \"fear\" might be operationally defined as specified changes in heart rate, galvanic skin response, pupil dilation, and blood pressure.<>An operational definition is a definition of a concept or variable that specifies how it is measured or operationalized in research. It is important to have operational definitions in research because they provide a clear, specific, and objective way of measuring a concept or variable. This helps to ensure that the concept or variable is being measured consistently and accurately across different studies and by different researchers.\n\n\n\nFor example, if a researcher is studying the concept of intelligence, they might define intelligence operatively as the score a person gets on a standardized intelligence test. In this case, the operational definition specifies exactly how intelligence is being measured in the study.\n\n\n\nOperational definitions are important because they help to ensure that research is replicable, meaning that other researchers can replicate the study using the same operational definitions and get similar results. This helps to build confidence in the validity and reliability of the research findings.<>wiki_csai
