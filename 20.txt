Why do grocery carts slowly turn as you push them ? This always annoys me . I would like to know if there 's a specific reason that grocery carts always seem to curve left as you push them or if it 's just a design flaw . Explain like I'm five.
If you push evenly on the cart then you will do the same work on both sides . Some of this energy will go to rotating the wheels allowing the cart to move . All wheels have friction as they spin around the axle . If there is more friction in the left wheel then it will lose its energy faster and it will spin slower . If your left wheel spins slower than your right wheel then the right wheel must cover more distance . Since the two wheels are attached to the cart the only way this is possible is if the cart curves to the left .
Grocery carts tend to turn left because of the way they are designed. The front wheels of a grocery cart are usually mounted on a pivot, which allows them to turn. The pivot is typically located on the right side of the cart, and this causes the cart to turn to the left when it is pushed forward.\r\n\r\nAnother reason that grocery carts turn left is because of the way that people tend to push them. Most people are right-handed, and they naturally push the cart with more force on the right side than on the left side. This causes the cart to turn to the left.\r\n\r\nOverall, the reason that grocery carts turn left is a combination of their design and the way that they are pushed. It is not necessarily a design flaw, but rather a result of the way that the carts are meant to function.
