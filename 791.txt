Why does a bag of chips usually have so few chips in it ? Relative to how large the bag is Please explain like I'm five.<>They are underfilled and contain mostly nitrogen for the air inside for 2 reasons . 1 . To prevent the chips from being smashed during delivery . 2 . The nitrogen is an inert gas that keeps the chips from going stale before being opened .<>A bag of chips usually has fewer chips in it because the chips take up space and the bag needs to be big enough to hold all of them. The bag also needs to have some extra space inside to allow the chips to move around and not get smashed. If the bag was filled completely with chips, the chips might break when the bag is handled or when you try to close it. It's also important to remember that the bag is not just filled with chips, it also contains air. Air helps keep the chips fresh and crisp. So even though the bag might seem big, it's actually mostly air, with just a small amount of chips inside.<>reddit_eli5
