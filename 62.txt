What is Unitarian Universalism ? I 've recently been trying to find myself in the world , and I came across Unitarian Universalism . I 've found a lot of mixed information . So , what is it ? Please explain like I'm five.<>It helps if you break it down . Unitarians are Christians who deny the Trinity , they say that God is One Person , that Jesus is either the son of , but not God , or that he and the Father are the same . They often also reject original sin , predestination , and biblical inerrancy . Universalism is a movement that emphasizes that religion is a fundamental aspect of human beings . In a Christian context , it 's the doctrine that all souls , no matter how sinful , will be reconciled to God by his love and mercy . Unitarian Universalism is the meeting of these two doctrines . They hold that religion is a universal part of being human , they talk a lot about the things that religions have in common , and they are accepting of people from any and every religious background , because in the end , we 're all going to be with God , no matter what book we read from now .<>Unitarian Universalism is a religion that believes in the importance of personal freedom, individual choice, and personal responsibility.
