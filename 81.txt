Why software developers use error codes and not just say exactly what is wrong ? Was playing Watch_Dogs 2 and was unable to connect to the servers . Instead of just saying \" No internet connection \" It says a bunch of gibberish . Explain like I'm five.<>Error codes report on the specific fault or symptom , not \" what is wrong \" . An error code that translates to \" Could n't connect to server \" for example , means that * for some reason * the program could n't connect . What exactly is wrong in that scenario ? It could be that your internet connection is down , the server is down , both are down , you turned off your wifi antenna , there 's a memory leak in the program 's net code , the net code is poorly written , and many , many more possibilities . So often , the error will be accompanied by * common * \" what is wrong \" causes of the error code \" Check your internet connection , check your firewall , server busy \/ try again later , etc . \"<>\\nSoftware developers use error codes rather than more descriptive messages because error codes can be more concise and easier to understand for computers and other software programs. Error codes are typically short strings of letters and numbers that are used to identify specific problems or issues.\\n\\nFor example, if a software program is unable to connect to a server, it might display an error code such as \"ERR_CONNECTION_FAILED\" or \"HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND\". These error codes can be quickly and easily understood by the software, and they can be used to help diagnose and fix the problem.\\n\\nIn some cases, error codes may be accompanied by more detailed messages that provide additional information about the problem. For example, if you see an error message that says \"ERR_CONNECTION_FAILED: Unable to connect to the server\", the error code \"ERR_CONNECTION_FAILED\" tells the software that there is a problem with the connection, while the message \"Unable to connect to the server\" provides more context and helps to explain the problem in a way that is easier for humans to understand.\\n<>\\nSoftware developers use error codes rather than more descriptive messages because error codes can be more concise and easier to understand for computers and other software programs.
