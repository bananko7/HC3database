If I were to eat pure nutrients and no superfluous water or fiber , would I have to poop ? What would I be pooping ? Please explain like I'm five.<>You would still ' poop ' waste products and dead cells etc .<>If you were to eat pure nutrients and no superfluous water or fiber, you would not have to poop because poop is made up of undigested food, bacteria, and other substances that are eliminated from the body. When you eat food, your body breaks down the nutrients in the food and absorbs them into your bloodstream to use as energy. Any waste products that are left over are eliminated from the body through the process of digestion, which includes the production of poop. So, if you were only eating pure nutrients and no superfluous water or fiber, there would be nothing left over to be eliminated as poop.<>reddit_eli5
