As an employee, when is it inappropriate to request to see your young\/startup company's financial statements?<>I think you need to realize that regardless of whether they are \"shady\" or not, owners\/founders are by and large in it for themselves. You as an employee as just a resource - why should they divulge their finances to you? You won't offend them if you pry and ask for it, but they simply are not going to give you the straight up. They will give you a bare minimum or some song and dance that beats around the bush without actually telling you what you need to know. In regards to whether you should buy the restricted shares: why not? Startups are a gamble anyway. So simply decide how much you're willing to gamble, and spend that much buying some shares. I mean, you're already taking the gamble by accepting a lower salary in exchange for equity which, in all likelihood, will never be worth anything anyway.<>As an employee, it is generally not appropriate to request to see the financial statements of your company unless you have a legitimate business reason for doing so. Some possible legitimate business reasons for an employee to request to see the financial statements of their company might include:To better understand the financial health of the company: Knowing the company's financial health can help employees make informed decisions about their own career and financial planning.To identify potential problems or areas for improvement: By examining the financial statements, employees may be able to identify potential problems or areas for improvement that could help the company grow and succeed.To assist with budgeting and forecasting: Employees who are responsible for managing budgets or making financial projections for the company may need access to the financial statements in order to do their jobs effectively.In general, employees should only request to see the financial statements of their company if they have a legitimate business reason for doing so and if their request is appropriate given their role and responsibilities within the company. It is important for employees to be respectful of the company's confidentiality and to respect the decision of their employer if their request is denied.<>finance
