Why do phone carriers no longer offer unlimited data plans ? I remember a few years back one could get phone plans with huge amounts of data - nowadays companies have brought the usage amounts to mere GB . What 's happened ? Explain like I'm five.<>Imagine a restaurant with a $ 10 all you can eat buffet . They probably charge $ 8 for a regular meal , so even if most people eat a little more than normal , they are still ahead . Even if an occasional hungry person eats $ 20 worth of food , they will still come out ok . Now let 's Overeaters Anonymous starts hanging out there . Each person is eating $ 40 , $ 50 , even $ 100 of food in a gluttonous orgy no normal person would even consider . The restaurant starts to lose money , and they are faced with a choice : * raise prices , basically charging more for normal people to pay for a few gluttons * close the buffer , and make people pay for what they eat That 's what happened with wireless providers . Most people would surf and send emails and get driving directions , and their \" unlimited \" usage was pretty normal . Other people made it into their primary internet connection and were downloading anime and porn 24\/7 . They basically ruined it for everyone .<>There are a few reasons why phone carriers might not offer unlimited data plans anymore. One reason is that as more people use data on their phones, the demand for data has increased, which means that phone carriers need to invest more money in building and maintaining their networks to support all of this data usage. It's expensive for them to provide unlimited data to all of their customers, so they might not offer it as a way to save money.\n\nAnother reason is that some people use a lot more data than others, and offering unlimited data to everyone means that some people might end up using much more than they really need. By offering data plans with a set amount of data, phone carriers can better control how much data each person uses and make sure that everyone has a fair share of the available data.\n\nOverall, offering unlimited data plans might not be practical or financially sustainable for phone carriers, so they might choose to offer data plans with a set amount of data instead.<>reddit_eli5
