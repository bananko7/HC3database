is there any evidence at all of life after death ? I know it 's pseudoscience at best , but is there any consensus even among people who believe in it ? Explain like I'm five. <>If you 're restricting yourself to scientific evidence , then no . If you 're open to non - scientific evidence , then yes .<>There is no scientific evidence for the existence of life after death. Many people believe in life after death because of their religious beliefs or personal experiences, but there is no way to prove or disprove these beliefs. Some people believe that when a person dies, their spirit or soul goes to a different place, such as heaven or another world, and that they continue to exist in some form. Others believe that when a person dies, their body stops functioning and they no longer exist in any form. There is no way to know for sure what happens after we die because we cannot observe or study it.<>There is no scientific evidence for the existence of life after death.
