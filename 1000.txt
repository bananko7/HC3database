Why can mice be inbred ? Why can mice be inbred for 20 generations and stay healthy , while most other animals ca n't ? edit : answered . ty ! apparently they 're fucked up too . Please explain like I'm five.<>Most animals have recessive genes that are damaging if you get two copies of the same one . However , if an animal is already inbred for many generations ( like such a mouse ) all the recessive genes have already been taken out of the gene pool ahead of time . Essentially , lab mice have been \" bred \" to be \" inbred \" .<>Mice can be inbred because they have short generation times, which means that they can produce many generations in a short period of time. This means that scientists can study the effects of inbreeding in mice more quickly than they can in other animals. Additionally, mice have a large number of offspring, which means that there are more opportunities for the inbred mice to have healthy babies. Finally, mice have a lot of genetic diversity, which means that they have many different genes that can help them to be healthy, even if they are inbred. This is why mice can be inbred for 20 generations and still be healthy, while other animals might not be able to handle the same amount of inbreeding.<>reddit_eli5
