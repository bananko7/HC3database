How do so many people who post obviously copyrighted video on YouTube have YouTube partnerships ( and therefore ads on their videos ) ? Is n't YouTube obligated to delete copyrighted video ? Explain like I'm five.<>It 's possible it 's not the video poster 's ad . I 've put up a video on YouTube with a copyrighted song during part of it , and a banner ad got put on it , with the money going to the song 's copyright holder , not me .<>YouTube is a platform that allows people to upload and share videos, and it has policies in place to try to ensure that people are not posting copyrighted content without permission. However, it is not always easy for YouTube to determine whether a video contains copyrighted material, especially if the video has been modified in some way. In addition, it is possible for someone to upload a video to YouTube that they do not have the rights to use, either intentionally or by mistake.\r\n\r\nIf someone uploads a video to YouTube that contains copyrighted material and the owner of the copyright complains to YouTube, YouTube will usually remove the video. However, this process can take some time, and in the meantime, the video may still be available on the platform and may even be earning money through ads.\r\n\r\nYouTube also has a program called the YouTube Partner Program, which allows some creators to earn money from their videos through ads. In order to be eligible for the program, creators must meet certain criteria, such as having a certain number of subscribers and views. However, this does not guarantee that all of the videos they upload to YouTube will be free of copyrighted material.\r\n\r\nOverall, it is important to remember that it is against the law to use someone else's copyrighted material without permission. If you want to use a song, a video, or any other type of content in your own work, you should make sure to get the necessary permissions before you do so.<>reddit_eli5
