Why did video games require memory cards when past games used to be able to save within the game itself ? * * Example :* * The Legend of Zelda and literally all Nintendo 64 games Explain like I'm five.
Cartridge games had the equivalent of memory cards built into the game cartridge . You ca n't do that with games on a CD . Well , technically you can if you have a CD - burner and a re - writable CD , but that technology was * much * more expensive than read - only CDs at the time , and memory cards were a cheaper alternative .
In the past, video game consoles did not have as much built-in storage as they do now. Memory cards were a way to store saved games, so that players could turn off the console and come back later to continue playing from where they left off. Memory cards were small and portable, so players could take their saved games with them if they wanted to play on a different console. Memory cards made it easy to save games and pick up where you left off, even if you weren't able to finish the game in one sitting. Does that help?
