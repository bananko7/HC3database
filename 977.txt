Why someone would want ALL drugs to be legalized I am pro - legalization for marijuana and other \" soft \" drugs , but why would legalizing drugs like meth be a good idea ? Explain like I'm five.<>By some measures , outlawing of popular recreational drugs results in considerably more societal ills than if we just regulated and taxed them . Because drugs are illegal , they are used to fund organized crime all over the world ; they force partakers to get involved with shady people ; they are not sufficiently researched for their effects on human health ; they are not regulated , so people end up buying and injecting all kinds of horrendously danger chemicals ; they continue to fuel the very expensive and very ineffective \" war on drugs \" , which results in prisons full of people who 've committed non - violent , victim - less crimes .<>It's important to note that there is not necessarily a single reason why someone might believe that all drugs should be legalized. Different people might have different reasons for supporting the legalization of all drugs. Here are a few potential reasons that someone might support the legalization of all drugs:\n\nPersonal freedom: Some people believe that adults should be free to make their own decisions about what they put into their bodies, as long as they are not harming others. They might argue that the government should not have the power to prohibit people from using drugs if they choose to do so.\n\nHealth and safety: Some people believe that drugs are safer when they are regulated and controlled by the government. They might argue that drugs like methamphetamine are currently produced in illegal labs, which can be dangerous and result in impure or contaminated products. Legalizing and regulating drugs could make them safer for people to use.\n\nReducing crime: Some people believe that the current laws against drugs create a black market for drugs, which can lead to criminal activity and violence. They might argue that legalizing drugs would reduce crime by taking away the illegal market for drugs.\n\nIt's important to note that these are just a few potential reasons why someone might support the legalization of all drugs. There are also many valid arguments against the legalization of all drugs, and the issue is complex and controversial.<>reddit_eli5
