What causes throbbing chest pain along with shortness of breath?I have a throbbing pounding pain in the middle of my chest between my breasts. I am not short of breath. The pain is constant. I noticed today that after swelling my food when it gets to that area it hurts going down. Also hurts more when I bend. The pain is constant and radiates across my back.<>Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you are having GERD (Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease). But as a rule in chest pain, we have to rule out cardiac and pulmonary causes.So get done ECG and 2D Echo to rule out cardiac causes.Get done chest x ray to rule out infection in the lungs.If all the above are normal than it is mostly GERD.It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Due to this acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the central chest pain.Try to follow these for better control of GERD.1. Avoid hot and spicy food.2. Avoid stress and anxiety. 3. Avoid large meals. Take small meals.4. Start proton pump inhibitors. 5. Go for walk after meals.6. Keep 2-3 pillows under your head in bad.<>Throbbing chest pain along with shortness of breath can be caused by a number of different conditions, including:\n\nAngina: This is chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle.
