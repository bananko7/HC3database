Why does a beer bottle massively foam and overflow if you hit the top with another bottle ? You know , the jerk at the party who hits your bottle and starts laughing as you try not to spill everywhere . Why does that work ? Explain like I'm five.<>The mechanism in play is the same one that causes the bottom to burst off of a bottle when it is filled with water and you strike the top . Basically when you hit the bottle , the bottle moves down faster than the liquid . This causes a cavitation ( vacuum ) to form . Almost as quickly as the cavitation forms , the liquid quickly and violently slams down to fill it . When the bottle is filled with water , all this energy just pops the bottom of the bottle off but when the bottle is filled with a carbonated beverage , the CO2 is quickly forced out of solution . Here it is in slow motion : URL_0 edit : this video shows the mechanism in action in both still liquids and carbonated liquids : URL_1<>When you hit the top of a bottle of beer with another bottle, the force of the impact causes the liquid inside the bottle to slosh around and create a lot of bubbles. These bubbles can rise to the top of the bottle very quickly, and as they rise, they create a lot of foam. The foam takes up more space than the liquid itself, so it can cause the bottle to overflow if there is not enough room for the foam to expand. This is what happens when someone hits your bottle at a party and the beer starts foaming and spilling out. It's a bit of a trick that some people like to play on their friends, but it can be a bit of a mess if you're not careful!<>reddit_eli5
