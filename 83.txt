Why do I get lightheaded when I stretch my body ? Even stretches where my head does n't go below my waist , like having one leg up on a beam and leaning forward , I always get lightheaded and have to stop . Why is that ? Explain like I'm five.
Stretching tells your body to put more blood in a certain area . This decreases the pressure in other parts , like your head . Imagine your body is a long , semi - inflated balloon that 's almost completely deflated at one end . When the balloon sends some of the air to the deflated portion , the rest of the balloon bets slightly less inflated as a result . The lightheadedness is caused by a slight drop in blood pressure . Eventually , your brain gets used to it and you get back to normal thinking abilities . IANADoctor , so there 's probably a more in - depth explanation , but this is ELI5 .
When you stretch your body, you are increasing the blood flow to different parts of your body. This can sometimes cause a temporary decrease in blood flow to your brain, which can cause you to feel lightheaded.\n\nYour brain needs a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients in order to function properly, and it gets these things through the blood that is pumped to it by your heart. When you stretch, your muscles need more oxygen, and the blood flow in your body increases to meet this demand.\n\nSometimes, when you stretch, the increased blood flow to your muscles can cause a temporary decrease in blood flow to your brain. This can make you feel lightheaded, especially if you are stretching for a long time or if you are stretching in a position that requires your head to be lower than your waist.\n\nIt's important to be careful when stretching and to stop if you feel lightheaded or dizzy. It's also a good idea to stretch slowly and gradually, rather than suddenly, to give your body time to adjust to the increased blood flow.
