depersonalisation ? I just need it explained as simply as possible , and how people feel when they have it ? thanks . Explain like I'm five.<>A constant obsessive thought about existence and how weird it feels to exist , and you feel like you do n't exist . At the same time , you know that you just have something wrong with your way of thinking and that life did n't always feel like it , and then you get depressed because you feel like you are going to spend the rest of your life in some fucked up world that does n't seem real . Or that 's how I felt , but then it went away after I forced myself to stop thinking about it .<>Sure! Depersonalization is a feeling of being detached or disconnected from your own body and thoughts. It can feel like you're observing yourself from the outside, or like you're in a dream or a movie. People who experience depersonalization may feel numb, disconnected from their emotions, or like they're going through the motions of life without really being present. It can be a very unsettling and distressing experience, and some people may feel anxious or depressed as a result.<>reddit_eli5
