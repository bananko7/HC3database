LLC Partnership Earned Income vs. Partnership Share<>It would appear that you are not actually \"equal\" partners.  You have differently valued interests and those values fluctuate based on individual performance.  The TurboTax advice is simplified for entities that don't track interests relative to partner inputs. IRC ยง 704(a), partner's distributive share is set by the partnership agreement, and ยง 704(b), failing an allocation by the agreement it is set by the partner's interest in the partnership.  But note ยง 704(b)(2), which prevents blatant tax-rigging in the partnership agreement.<>In an LLC partnership, earned income refers to the profits or revenues generated by the business through its operations. This income is typically shared among the partners according to the terms of the partnership agreement.A partnership share, on the other hand, refers to the portion of the profits or losses of the business that each partner is entitled to receive. This may be based on the percentage of ownership each partner has in the LLC or as specified in the partnership agreement.For example, if an LLC partnership generates $100,000 in earned income and has two partners who each own 50% of the business, each partner would be entitled to receive a partnership share of $50,000. However, the partnership agreement may specify that one partner is entitled to a larger share of the profits due to their contribution to the business or other considerations.It's important to note that earned income and partnership share are not the same thing. Earned income refers to the overall profits of the business, while partnership share refers to the individual share of those profits that each partner is entitled to receive.<>finance
