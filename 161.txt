Please explain what is \"Animal cognition\"<>Animal cognition encompasses the mental capacities of non-human animals including insect cognition. The study of animal conditioning and learning used in this field was developed from comparative psychology. It has also been strongly influenced by research in ethology, behavioral ecology, and evolutionary psychology;  the alternative name cognitive ethology is sometimes used. Many behaviors associated with the term animal intelligence are also subsumed within animal cognition.\nResearchers have examined animal cognition in mammals (especially primates, cetaceans, elephants, dogs, cats, pigs, horses, cattle, raccoons and rodents), birds (including parrots, fowl, corvids and pigeons), reptiles (lizards, snakes, and turtles), fish and invertebrates (including cephalopods, spiders and insects).<>Animal cognition refers to the mental capacities of non-human animals. It includes the ability to process information, perceive and attend to stimuli, learn and remember, solve problems, and make decisions. These cognitive abilities are thought to be mediated by brain functions, and research on animal cognition seeks to understand the neural and psychological mechanisms underlying these abilities.\n\n\n\nStudies of animal cognition have been conducted in a variety of species, including mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish. These studies have revealed that many animals are capable of sophisticated cognitive abilities, such as problem-solving, learning, and decision-making. For example, some animals are able to use tools, communicate with others, and navigate complex environments.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding animal cognition can provide insight into the evolution of cognitive abilities in humans and other animals, and can also inform the development of animal-friendly practices in fields such as animal welfare, conservation, and animal-assisted therapy.<>wiki_csai
