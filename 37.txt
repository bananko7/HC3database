Why is it so difficult to travel faster than the speed of light ? What makes light so special ? Explain like I'm five.
It 's not hard for an ordinary object to travel faster than the speed of light . It 's * * impossible * * . Completely 100 % impossible . It will never happen . That is because ordinary objects have mass . And in order for an ordinary object to accelerate ( get its speed up ) to the speed of light , the object would requite an * * infinite amount of energy * * . That 's really all you need to know ( but you could always learn the reasons more in - depth if you want to ) . There is also the issue of time dilation and length contraction . Say I want to go to a star that is 3 light - years away . ( That is a long distance . A light - year is the distance light can travel in a year , around five trillion miles . ) If I travel to the star at 99 % the speed of light ( which is possible ) , it will take me about 3 years and 1 month to reach the star . * * BUT WAIT * * . Who says I 'm travelling at 99 % the speed of light ? Who says I 'm even moving at all ? You could say * relative to the earth and sun * I am moving at 99 % the speed of light . But the earth and sun are moving too . So what is my * real * speed ? How fast am I * really * moving ? Albert Einstein ( ever heard of him ? ) answered this question . The answer is that there is no real speed . Any measurement of your speed is relative to which reference frame you choose . So there are infinite different speeds you are moving , based on infinite different reference frames you could measure from . So you are moving at 99 % the speed of light relative to the earth , but you are standing still relative to yourself , and you might be moving at 99.5 % the speed of light relative tot he star ( if the star is also moving towards you ) . * * BUT WAIT * * what about that 3 years and 1 month ? That measurement was made from earth . From earth 's reference , the star is 3 light years away and you are moving at 99 % the speed of light . But that 's what the earth sees . That 's not what you see . You see the earth going away from you at 99 % the speed of light and the star coming towards you at 99 % the speed of light ... Here 's the odd part . Because of length contraction , the * * distance * * you measure to the star is smaller than the distance someone on the earth measures . You measure a smaller distance , about half a light year . So it only takes you about 6 months to get there . * * BUT WAIT * * . If someone on the earth thinks it took you 3 years to get there , and you think it only took 6 months to get there , who is right ? The answer ( Einstein again ) , is that you are both right . You will age 6 months , while 3 years pass on earth .
It's actually not that difficult to travel faster than the speed of light in some sense. For example, if you're on a train that's moving very fast, you could run down the aisle and exceed the speed of light relative to someone standing on the platform.\n\nThe reason it's difficult to travel faster than the speed of light in the sense that most people mean is that it takes an infinite amount of energy to accelerate any object with mass to the speed of light. This is because the faster you go, the more energy you need to keep going faster. So if you tried to accelerate a spaceship to the speed of light, you would need an infinite amount of energy, which is not possible with our current technology.\n\nLight is special because it is made up of particles called photons that have no mass. This means that light can travel at the speed of light without needing any energy at all. In fact, light always travels at the speed of light, no matter how fast you are moving relative to it. This is why light is often used to study things like time dilation and the theory of relativity.
