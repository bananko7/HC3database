The advantages and disadvantages of WEP , WPA and WPA2 Advantages and disadvantages for all three . Explain like I'm five.<>Basicly these are the locks you put on your wifi ( wireless internet \/ network ) WEP is the oldest lock , this has the advantage that everything knows how to make a key for it ( if you know the password ) . In other words every computer or device that can use WIFI should be able to use WEP . The disadvantage is that its not as secure . Its an old lock an can be more easely broken . WPA2 is the new secure lock . Not everybody knows how to make a key for it but most do . ( In other words any computer that is n't too old should be able to connect to this . The only device I 've seen so fat that could n't was a nintendo DS , the first one . anything older should be fine and older will probably be too ) It is generaly accepted that the lock is unbreakable ( within a reasonable timespan of more than a couple of years ) by brute force . ( trying all posibilities ) tl;dr Get WPA2 , its more secure and you should n't have any compatebility problems . Even if you do you can revert back to WEP but WEP is way easier to hack Source : I studied IT and now work in IT<>WEP, WPA, and WPA2 are different types of security protocols that can be used to protect a wireless network. Here's a breakdown of the main advantages and disadvantages of each:\n\nWEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy):\n\nAdvantages:\n\nWEP was one of the first security protocols for wireless networks, so it has been around for a long time and is widely supported.\nDisadvantages:\n\nWEP is not very secure. It is easy for hackers to break into a WEP-protected network, so it is not recommended for use today.\nWPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access):\n\nAdvantages:\n\nWPA provides stronger security than WEP. It is more difficult for hackers to break into a WPA-protected network.\n\nWPA can be configured to use either a personal or enterprise (corporate) security model.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nWPA is not as secure as WPA2, which was introduced later.\nWPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2):\n\nAdvantages:\n\nWPA2 is the most secure security protocol for wireless networks. It is very difficult for hackers to break into a WPA2-protected network.\n\nWPA2 can be configured to use either a personal or enterprise security model.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nSome older devices may not support WPA2, so you may need to use WPA or even WEP on these devices.\nI hope this helps!
