- Which variable should I put on which axis ? I have a general idea but is there a simple rule of thumb I can refer to ? Explain like I'm five.<>You usually put the dependent variable ( what 's being measured or tracked ) on the y - axis and the independent variable ( e.g. time ) on the x - axis<>When you want to make a graph to show the relationship between two different things, you typically put one of those things on the x-axis and the other thing on the y-axis. Here's a simple rule of thumb: If one of the things you are comparing is something that changes over time (like the temperature outside on different days), you should usually put that on the x-axis. If one of the things you are comparing is something that doesn't change over time (like the type of fruit you are comparing), you should usually put that on the y-axis. Here's an example to help make this more clear: Let's say you want to make a graph to show how much fruit you eat on different days. You could put the type of fruit on the y-axis and the days of the week on the x-axis. This way, you can see how much of each type of fruit you ate on each day of the week. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.<>reddit_eli5
