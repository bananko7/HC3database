How come you ca n't give blood in the US if you 've lived in first - world nations like France , the UK , or Greece ? It 's not like the plague is still rampant . Explain like I'm five.<>There are many concerns besides the plague . Mad cow disease is the one that springs to my mind first , but countries have different standards for blood control , and what does and does not constitute \" safe \" blood . The rules are simply an attempt to balance blood supply with blood safety ; restrictive enough to make the blood supply safe , even if some safe people get rejected , without being so restrictive as to make testing impractical or choke off the blood supply .<>There are certain countries that have a higher risk of certain infectious diseases than others, and as a result, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has regulations in place to protect the blood supply in the United States from these diseases. People who have lived in or traveled to certain countries may be at risk of carrying infectious diseases that can be transmitted through blood transfusions, and so the FDA has guidelines in place to prevent this from happening. It's not that the countries you mentioned (France, the UK, and Greece) are necessarily high-risk for all infectious diseases, but rather that the FDA has determined that there is a higher risk of certain diseases being present in these countries, and so they have put restrictions in place to protect the blood supply.<>reddit_eli5
