How they made a Tupac Hologram at Coachella Hopefully title says it all . I 'm freaking out trying to understand how they had a recording of Tupac that they could put on stage and have him say along the lines of \" what s up Coachella \" . Explain like I'm five.<>I ca n't really ELI5 it , but URL_1 and URL_0 can send you in the right direction . edit : quote from Wiki - The system works by placing thin metallised film across the front of the stage at angle of 45 degrees towards the audience ; recessed below the screen is a bright image supplied by an LED screen or powerful projector . When viewed from the audience 's perspective , the reflected images appear to be on the stage .<>The Tupac hologram that appeared at Coachella in 2012 was created using a technology called holographic projection. Holographic projection involves projecting a 3D image onto a transparent screen, creating the illusion of a 3D object or person being present in the room.\n\nTo create the Tupac hologram, the creators used a combination of computer-generated imagery (CGI) and live action footage of Tupac. They took existing recordings of Tupac's voice and used CGI to create a 3D model of his body. They then used this 3D model to create a holographic projection of Tupac on stage.\n\nThe holographic projection was controlled by a computer, which was programmed to move the holographic Tupac in a way that made it appear as if he was performing on stage. The holographic Tupac was able to move and speak, creating the impression that he was actually present at the event.\n\nOverall, the Tupac hologram was created using a combination of advanced technology and careful planning, and it was able to create the illusion of Tupac being present on stage at Coachella in 2012.<>reddit_eli5
