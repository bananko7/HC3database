How do people \" blackout \" from drinking too many alcoholic beverages but remain conscious with no recollection ? This happens to me way too often so I might as well understand what is happening . Explain like I'm five.
Your brain has to keep track of a lot of different things at the same time . Part of the brain deals with this \" what 's going on right now \" information . It 's way too much information to store long term though . So your brain makes decisions on what gets moved into \" I should remember this later \" parts of the brain and what just gets thrown away to make room for what 's continuing to happen right now . Alcohol messes with the brains ability to move stuff into longer term memory . You drink enough of it and it pretty much shuts down the process all together , which means by the time you recover from your drunken stupor , you brain did n't save any of that information .
When people drink too much alcohol, it can affect their brain and central nervous system in a way that causes them to lose consciousness or \"black out.\" This means they might become unable to remember things that happened while they were under the influence of alcohol.\n\nWhen people drink alcohol, it is absorbed into their bloodstream and travels to their brain, where it can affect the way their brain cells communicate with each other. Alcohol can interfere with the brain's ability to store new memories and can cause people to have trouble remembering things that happened while they were drinking.\n\nSometimes, when people drink too much alcohol, their brain and body become so impaired that they lose consciousness and pass out. When this happens, their brain is not able to record new memories, so they have no recollection of what happened while they were unconscious.\n\nIt's important to be aware of the effects of alcohol and to drink responsibly to avoid blacking out or putting yourself or others at risk. If you find that you are frequently blacking out after drinking, it may be a sign that you are drinking too much and should consider seeking help.
