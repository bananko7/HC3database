How did explorers map areas without satillites ? I was browsing r \/ mapporn and wondered how did people have maps of the world if there were no satellites . And most of the world was undiscovered . Explain like I'm five.
You travel somewhere and you draw a map as you go . It was n't very accurate but it did in a pinch .
Explorers used a variety of techniques to map areas without satellites. One common method was to use celestial navigation, which involves using the position of the sun, moon, and stars to determine location. This can be done using instruments like a sextant or a compass.\r\n\r\nExplorers would also use landmarks on the ground, such as mountains or rivers, to help them navigate and create maps. They would also use maps created by previous explorers and indigenous people, and combine that information with their own observations to create more accurate maps.\r\n\r\nFinally, explorers would use surveying techniques, such as measuring distances and angles between points on the ground, to create detailed maps of specific areas. This could be done using instruments like a theodolite or a transit.\r\n\r\nOverall, it took a lot of hard work, careful observation, and ingenuity for explorers to create maps of the world before satellites were available.
