One reason is that they feel that the Scottish government would be better able to make decisions that are in the best interests of Scotland and its people if it had more control over its own affairs. Some people also believe that an independent Scotland would have more opportunities to pursue its own economic and foreign policies, rather than being bound by the decisions of the UK government. It's worth noting that there is not a unanimous consensus in Scotland on the issue of independence. Some people believe that remaining part of the UK offers certain benefits, such as access to a larger market and shared resources. Others believe that independence would be too risky or uncertain, and that the costs of establishing a new country would outweigh any potential benefits. Ultimately, the decision about whether or not to seek independence is a complex one that involves a range of political, economic, and social factors. It's up to the people of Scotland to weigh the pros and cons and decide what is best for their country.<>reddit_eli5
