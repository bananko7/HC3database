Synesthesia I have looked up and read about this but I just STILL do not get it . I would love a barney style breakdown for me . Explain like I'm five.<>Syn means combining . Aesthesia means the senses . Synaesthesia is when senses are combined . One of the more common forms of synaesthesia is the sensing of colors with certain numbers , letters , or words . A synaesthete ( a person who experiences synaesthesia ) might sense the color blue when seeing the number 7 , even though the number is displayed in black text on a white background . It 's not quite seeing , as I understand it , since the color perception does n't come in through the eyes , but it is seeing in the sense that it comes from the vision center of the brain .<>Sure! Synesthesia is a condition where people experience things in a way that is different from most people. For example, some people with synesthesia might see colors when they hear music, or taste words when they see numbers.\r\n\r\nIt's a little bit like when you close your eyes and imagine what a apple would look like, but for people with synesthesia, it's like they are actually seeing the color of the apple with their eyes open.\r\n\r\nSynesthesia is not a disorder or a problem, it's just a way that some people's brains work differently. It can be really interesting and fun for people with synesthesia, but it can also be confusing for them if other people don't understand how they see things.\r\n\r\nSo, in short, synesthesia is when your brain connects things that most people don't connect, like seeing colors when you hear music or tasting words when you see numbers.<>reddit_eli5
