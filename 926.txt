What does being Turing complete means ? I 've seen it 's a machine that can solve any computational problem , but can you ELI5 please ? Explain like I'm five. <>Turing described a minimal , hypothetical computer which he used to mathematically prove results , known as a Turing Machine . It was n't intended as a practical device , but rather to be as simple as possible to make proofs easier . A computing device that is capable of doing everything that a Turing Machine can is Turing Complete . One way to show that a computer or programming environment is Turing Complete is to implement a Turing Machine emulator .<>Sure! Being Turing complete means that a machine has the ability to perform any computation that any other computer is capable of. It's named after Alan Turing, a famous computer scientist who did a lot of important work in the field of computation.\\n\\nHere's a simple way to think about it: imagine that you have a set of instructions that you can follow to complete a task. These instructions could be things like \"add two numbers together\" or \"compare two numbers to see which is bigger.\" A Turing complete machine is like a robot that can follow any set of instructions that you give it, no matter how complex or difficult the task might be.\\n\\nSo, if you have a problem that you need to solve using a computer, and you can break that problem down into a series of instructions, a Turing complete machine should be able to solve it for you. It's like having a really smart robot that can do anything you ask it to, as long as you can give it clear and precise instructions.<>reddit_eli5
