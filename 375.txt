short selling stocks and currencies I 've read a bit about it but I would really value a more simple and I depth explanation . Thanks in advance ! Explain like I'm five.<>Say you think your local store is going to have a sale on Star Wars DVDs . You want to make some money . You got a friend who can lend you some Star Wars DVDs . You take those Star Wars DVDs and sell them on eBay . Now the time comes when you have to return your DVDs , you go down to the store where a sale is going on , you buy back the same DVDs at a discount and you return them to your friend . You pocket the difference that is the discount . Alternatively situation : You reach the store and find they 're sold out ! The only one selling Star Wars DVDs is Neckebard 's Super Pricey Nerd DVDs , they charge 20x times what you sold them on eBay for . Though luck , you have to buy it at that price and return it to your friend . Basically , borrow the stock , sell now , buy back later , return the stock . Short selling is considered risky because there 's limited profit ( the company goes bankrupt and the stock is worthless , you keep the entire amount you sold it for ) , but the risk is unlimited ( the company announces they have a product that cures cancer , world hunger , and the impulse to commit terrorism , they get a controlling share of the world , you sold for $ 10 , the stock is now $ 90 bajillion , you 're effectively bankrupt ) .<>\\nSure! Short selling is a way to make money when the price of a stock or other investment goes down. Here's how it works:\\n\\nImagine that you think the price of a stock called ABC is going to go down. You can borrow some shares of ABC from someone else, sell them at the current price, and then buy them back later at a lower price. If the price does go down, you can buy the shares back for less than you sold them for, return them to the person you borrowed them from, and keep the difference as profit.\\n\\nFor example, let's say you borrow 100 shares of ABC from someone and sell them for $50 each, for a total of $5,000. A few days later, the price of ABC goes down to $40 per share. You buy 100 shares back for $4,000 and return them to the person you borrowed them from. You have made a profit of $1,000 ($5,000 - $4,000) by short selling ABC.\\n\\nShort selling can be risky, because if the price of ABC goes up instead of down, you'll have to buy the shares back for more than you sold them for, and you'll lose money.\\n\\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.<>reddit_eli5
