Are there physiological consequences to cannibalism ? I have no interest in eating a human , but I 'm curious about what it does to the cannibal 's body . Does he have negative physiological outcomes that would not come from eating , say , chicken ? Explain like I'm five.<>Nope . Meat is meat ( roughly speaking ) . It 'd be the same as eating any other apex omnivore , like bears . People used to eat bear all the time . You should balance your diet , of course , by also eating everything from a person 's garden after you slaughter them .<>Cannibalism, which is the act of consuming human flesh, can have a number of negative physiological consequences. These consequences can vary depending on the circumstances under which the cannibalism takes place and the specific parts of the human body that are consumed.\r\n\r\nOne potential consequence of cannibalism is the transmission of diseases. Humans can carry a number of diseases that can be transmitted through the consumption of their flesh, such as prion diseases like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and kuru, or viral diseases like HIV and hepatitis. These diseases can cause a wide range of symptoms, including fever, muscle weakness, difficulty speaking and thinking, and eventually, death.\r\n\r\nAnother potential consequence of cannibalism is the risk of injury or infection from consuming raw or undercooked human flesh. Just like with any other type of food, if human flesh is not prepared properly, it can contain harmful bacteria or parasites that can cause illness.\r\n\r\nFinally, there are also cultural and social consequences to cannibalism. In many societies, cannibalism is considered taboo and can lead to social ostracization or even criminal charges.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, cannibalism can have a number of negative physiological, cultural, and social consequences. It is not a practice that is condoned or recommended by any reputable medical or scientific organization.<>reddit_eli5
