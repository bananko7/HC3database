Why do some computers need incredibly complex cooling systems ? Why are n't fans sufficient ? I read up on the wiki page about computer cooling , but as a layman whose knowledge of physics is poor , I did n't really understand most of it . Explain like I'm five.<>High performance parts perform high because they use more energy . Using more energy creates more heat , needing more cooling . After a while , new tech developments allow the same performance on smaller components needing less energy , generating less heat , needing less cooling .<>Computers produce heat when they are running, and if this heat is not dissipated effectively, it can cause the computer to malfunction or even damage the components inside. Cooling systems, such as fans and heatsinks, help to dissipate this heat and keep the computer running smoothly.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, such as with high-performance computers or servers that are constantly running at high speeds, the heat production can be much higher and a simple fan may not be sufficient to keep the temperature at a safe level. These computers may require more advanced cooling systems, such as water cooling or liquid cooling, which use fluid to dissipate the heat more effectively.\r\n\r\nThink of it like this: if you are running really fast and getting hot, a fan can help to cool you down. But if you are running really fast for a long time, you might get too hot even with a fan. In this case, you might need to take a dip in a pool to cool off more effectively. That's kind of like how water cooling works for a computer.<>reddit_eli5
