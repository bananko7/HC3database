What is \" gerrymandering \" ? I 've been seeing this word used a lot in relation to the shutdown , and as a reason for why representatives will get reelected . Explain like I'm five.<>What honey badger something said : \" It 's when electoral districts are redrawn in order to favor a specific party or candidate based on demographics . \" And check out [ the wikipedia article ] ( URL_2 ) . ------------------ Imagine a pretend 51st state in the US . We 'll call it the State of Calville . Calville gets 10 Representatives to send to the US House of Representatives . If you 're a Democrat you would like as many Democrats as possible ; if you 're a Republican you would like as many Republicans as possible . Because Calville gets 10 Representatives it needs 10 districts . Each district = 1 Representative . How do you draw the borders to make these districts ? One way is to draw the borders to make sure that your party gets as many of those 10 Representative spots as possible . There are 2 basic ways to do that . 1 . Put ( groups of ) voters together . 2 . Put ( groups of ) voters apart . 1 . Let 's pretend a group of people always vote for Republicans : people over 6 feet tall . And you 're a Democrat and you 're in charge of drawing the borders of the 10 districts . You can draw it so that every person over 6 feet tall is in one , and only one , district . It could look [ something like this ] ( URL_0 ) or [ like this ] ( URL_1 ) . You 're basically giving up that one district . You know that Democrats will never be able to win it . But you also know that Democrats will have a * * much better * * chance in the other 9 because all the Republican voters are in 1 district . So you 're drawing the borders so you get 9 districts \/ Representatives and Republicans get 1 district \/ Representative . You 're basically using the ability to make borders to get the electoral outcome you want and not the electoral outcome the people \/ voters want . 2 . Let 's keep going with our hypothetical . You 're a Democrat writing the rules and you only care about getting as many Democrats elected as possible . Let 's also say 20 % of people in Calville are over 6 feet tall . They will vote Republican no matter what . A fair person might say something like : at least 20 % of the population wants Republican Representatives , therefore it 's fair that * at least * 2\/10 Representatives should be Republican . But you , you do n't care about fair or what voters want . You only want to win . ( Bastard ! ) So you take that 20 % and you spread them around . You make sure that each district has 20 % , but no more , of people over 6 feet tall . That way you might be able to win all 10 districts \/ Representatives ! So even though a fair outcome would be at least 2 Republicans , you 've abused your power to make sure you get the result you want and not what the people \/ voters want . If a Republican is from a district which is 90 % people over 6 feet tall then they do n't really have to worry about being re - elected . If a Democrat is from a district where they know that only 20 % of people are over 6 feet tall then they may not have to worry about being re - elected . -------------------------- It 's a real problem and it ( basically ) disenfranchises real people .<>Gerrymandering is a way that politicians can try to change the boundaries of voting districts in a way that helps them win elections. It's a way of manipulating the system to try to get an unfair advantage.\r\n\r\nImagine a state with 100 people who are going to vote in an election. The state is divided into 10 voting districts, with 10 people in each district. If the politicians want to make it easier for their party to win, they might redraw the lines of the districts so that all the people who usually vote for the other party are put into just one district. Now, that district has all the people who usually vote for the other party, and the other nine districts have more people who usually vote for the politicians' party. This makes it easier for the politicians' party to win, because they have a lot more districts where they have a majority of the votes.\r\n\r\nGerrymandering is a way for politicians to try to control the outcome of an election by changing the way the voting districts are drawn. It can be a controversial practice, because it can give some parties an unfair advantage over others.<>reddit_eli5
