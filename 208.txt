How to make a decision for used vs new car if I want to keep the car long term?<>New cars are sold for about $500 over their blue book value. They drop in value by about 20% their first year. Used cars are sold for about $2,500 above their blue book. They depreciate like normal. My advice based on my personal experience is to get a new car. When buying a used car, remember that the previous owner sold it for a reason. You are buying someone else's problems.  Average car is flipped every 4 years when it takes 5 years to pay it off. Don't do that...keep it for 5+ years if you get a new car. My knowledge comes from being a Chevrolet car salesman. This info is generalized and about 10 years old.<>There are several factors to consider when deciding whether to purchase a used or new car:Cost: New cars tend to be more expensive than used cars. However, used cars may have hidden costs, such as needing repairs or maintenance.Depreciation: New cars depreciate quickly in the first few years of ownership, while used cars have already experienced a significant portion of their depreciation.Warranty: New cars often come with a manufacturer's warranty, while used cars may not.Reliability: New cars are generally more reliable than used cars, as they have not experienced as much wear and tear.Features: New cars often come with the latest technology and safety features, while used cars may not have these features.To make the decision, consider your budget and the costs associated with each option. Think about how long you plan to keep the car and whether you are willing to pay a premium for the benefits of a new car. It may also be helpful to research the reliability and repair histories of different models and compare them to your budget and needs.","There are a few factors to consider when deciding between a used or a new car if you want to keep the car long term:Cost: New cars tend to be more expensive than used cars, so if you are looking to save money, a used car may be a better option.

Used cars, on the other hand, may not have a warranty or may have a limited warranty.Features: New cars often come with the latest technology and features, which can be appealing. Used cars may not have the same features, or they may be less up-to-date.Ultimately, the decision between a used or a new car will depend on your personal circumstances, including your budget, your priorities, and your desired features.
