What 's the speed of electricity ? The speed of light ? And do cables and other mediums affect it ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Electrical signals travel at the speed of light * * in the medium . * * The speed of light , like the speed of sound , slows depending on the medium it 's traveling through . So electricity will flow through a wire at the speed of light through the wire , which will be slower than the speed of light in a vacuum . However , the actually electrons in the wire move incredibly slow . In a copper wire , they 'll move ~.00028 m\/s<>Electricity is the flow of electrons, which are tiny particles that are part of atoms. The speed of electricity is not a constant value and can vary depending on the material that it is traveling through. In general, electricity travels at a speed of about 1\/100th the speed of light through most materials. \nThe speed of light, on the other hand, is a constant value and is very fast - about 186,282 miles per second (299,792,458 meters per second). This is the fastest speed that anything can travel. \nCables and other mediums, such as wires and conductors, can affect the speed of electricity. For example, if the material that the electricity is traveling through has a lot of resistance, it can slow down the flow of electricity. On the other hand, if the material has a low resistance, it can allow the electricity to flow more quickly. \nSo, to sum it up: the speed of electricity is not as fast as the speed of light, and it can be affected by the materials that it is traveling through.<>reddit_eli5
