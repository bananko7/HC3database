Why men and women have different chess tournaments ? It is pretty much self explanatory in sports like soccer , tennis , boxing etc because male are physically stronger . But why we have different tournaments in chess which solely depends on mental level . Explain like I'm five. <>Just as a correction , there are n't men - only tournaments . There are open tournaments , and then those that are for women - only . This is a fairly common theme across all sorts of activities , women simply do n't compete at high enough level to take part in open for all tournaments so they just wo n't participate , or participate in very small numbers . Why almost all competitive things have almost no women anywhere near top-1000 rankings , I do not know . It 's a peculiar thing . However , I feel like I should mention that parents of Judit Polgar were sort of trying to prove that parenting and education has huge effect . Judit Polgar became one of the strongest chess players alive(and as far as I know , by far the strongest female player ) , so it 's kind of hard to dismiss her parents views about how to become the best of the best .<>Men and women have different chess tournaments because chess is a game that requires a lot of skill and strategy, and men and women are equally capable of being skilled and strategic at the game. However, men and women may have different physical abilities, and in sports that require physical strength, it makes sense to have separate tournaments for men and women so that the competition is fair. In chess, there is no physical advantage or disadvantage, so men and women can compete against each other in the same tournament. However, some people believe that having separate tournaments for men and women can help promote and support women in chess, and can also help to recognize and celebrate the achievements of female chess players.<>reddit_eli5
