I about Bitcoins , but how exactly do you get them ? I read that you have to mine for them , but how do you mine ? Also , is it possible to just purchase Bitcoins ? Explain like I'm five.<>Looking to make some \" purchases \" off the Silk Road , eh ?<>Bitcoins are a type of digital currency that can be used for online transactions. They are created through a process called mining, which involves using powerful computers to solve complex mathematical problems. When a computer solves one of these problems, it is rewarded with a small amount of bitcoins. This is how new bitcoins are created and added to the total supply. In addition to mining, it is also possible to purchase bitcoins from online exchanges or from individuals who already own them. You can buy bitcoins using traditional currencies like U.S. dollars, or you can use other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum or Litecoin to purchase them. To sum it up, there are two main ways to get bitcoins: by mining them or by purchasing them.<>reddit_eli5
