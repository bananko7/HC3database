why do n't all states have a deposit on cans and glassware ? Seeing how states that have deposits on cans and glassware have higher percentages when there is a deposit , would n't it be beneficial to have deposits in all states ? Please explain like I'm five.<>This requires the state to pay money in order to increase recycling . If the state does n't have the money , or does n't value recycling as much , they wo n't do it . Also many states do have deposits , it is just less than MI .<>States that have deposits on cans and glassware, also known as \"bottle bills,\" often have higher recycling rates for those items because the deposit provides a financial incentive for people to recycle them. This can be beneficial because recycling cans and glassware helps to conserve natural resources, reduce pollution, and save energy.However, not all states have bottle bills for a few reasons. One reason is that it can be more expensive for businesses to manage the bottle deposit system, and they may pass those costs on to consumers through higher prices. Additionally, some people argue that the bottle deposit system is not the most efficient way to increase recycling rates and that other methods, such as curbside recycling programs, might be more effective. Finally, implementing a bottle deposit system can require a significant amount of time and resources, and some states may not have the political will or infrastructure in place to do so.<>reddit_eli5
