Do money markets fluctuate during market crashes?
Wikipedia has a solid article on Money Market Funds which includes a section on \"Breaking the Buck\" when the money market fund fails to return its full dollar.  Money market funds smoothing out the daily (generally small) fluctuations of investing in short-term treasuries directly but have similar risk over longer periods.  Some funds can and have lost money in market crashes, though even the worst performers still returned 95+ cents on the dollar. While few investments are guaranteed and likely none in your retirement account,  money-market funds are likely the choice you have with the least fluctuation and similar minimal risk to short term treasuries. However, a second important risk to consider is inflation.  Money market funds generally have returns similar or less than the inflation rate.  While money markets funds help you avoid the fluctuations of the stock market the value of your retirement account falls behind the cost of goods over time.  Unless the investor is fairly old most financial professionals would recommend only a small portion of a retirement account be in money market instruments.  Vanguard also has a set of target retirement investment funds that are close to what many professionals would recommend.  Consulting a financial professional to discuss your particular needs is a good option as well.
Yes, money markets can fluctuate during market crashes. Money markets refer to financial markets that deal with short-term borrowing and lending of funds, usually with maturities of one year or less. These markets are characterized by low risk and relatively low returns, as the funds are typically invested in highly liquid, low-risk assets such as government securities or high-quality commercial paper.During a market crash, the value of many assets, including those held in money markets, can decline significantly. This can lead to fluctuations in the value of money market instruments, such as certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and Treasury bills. In addition, market participants may become more risk-averse during a market crash, which could lead to a reduction in demand for money market instruments and further fluctuations in their value.It's important to note that money markets are generally considered to be less volatile than other financial markets, such as the stock market, and are often seen as a safer place to park funds during times of market uncertainty. However, they are not completely immune to market fluctuations, and investors should be aware of the potential risks involved in investing in money market instruments.
