Why is my singing voice so much deeper just after waking up ? I notice I can hit notes lower than normal just after waking up from sleep . Please explain like I'm five.
Baritone here ( which means I secretly love being a bass in the mornings).Your vocal cords are relaxed when you wake up , which allows them to vibrate more easily than after a day of normal conversation . Since lower tones are created by slower vibrations , you 're able to talk or sing lower when you wake up .
When you sleep, your body goes into a state of relaxation, which can affect the muscles in your throat and vocal cords. As a result, your singing voice may sound deeper just after waking up because the muscles in your throat and vocal cords are relaxed and not as tense as they usually are. This can allow your vocal cords to vibrate more freely, which can produce a lower pitch. \nIt's important to warm up your voice before singing or speaking for extended periods of time, especially if you've just woken up. This can help to get your vocal muscles ready to produce sound and prevent strain or injury to your voice. \nSo, in short, your singing voice may sound deeper just after waking up because your vocal muscles are relaxed and not as tense as they usually are, which can allow your vocal cords to vibrate more freely and produce a lower pitch.
