' Diet ' drinks and how they have zero calories . What is all that stuff in there and how is it , uh , nothing ? Explain like I'm five.<>Zero Calorie drink are actually drinks that have less the 0.5 calories . They choose to round down to zero . Calories are a measurement of energy in food . Not every part of any food item can be used for energy . For example Celery has a extremely low amount of usable energy because of all the cellulose in it ( Human can not properly digest Cellulose ) Diet Soda is mostly water , coloring , artificial flavoring and artificial sweetener . A common one is Aspartame which is 200 times sweet then sugar . This means you have to use so little of it that the total amount generates less then 1 calorie per drink .<>Sure! Some drinks that people call \"diet\" drinks are made with artificial sweeteners instead of sugar, which is what makes them have zero calories. Artificial sweeteners are chemicals that are made in a laboratory and are many times sweeter than sugar, but they don't provide any calories or energy when we consume them. This means that we can use a very small amount of artificial sweetener to sweeten our drinks and foods, without adding any calories. Some examples of artificial sweeteners include aspartame, sucralose, and stevia.<>reddit_eli5
