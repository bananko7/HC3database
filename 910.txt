What was the evolutionary advantage to having women be physically weaker than men ? Obviously there are exceptions but for the most part males are physically stronger than females . Not trying to offend anyone I 'm just genuinely curious . Explain like I'm five.<>It was more an evolutionary advantage to have stronger men . The men are generally more disposable ( 1 guy and 100 women can make a lot more babies than 1 woman and 100 guys ) and thus were used to protect the women . The stronger men survived and reproduced , the weaker men died . However , as the women were not fighting , strength was not an evolutionary advantage for them .<>,"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5"}
