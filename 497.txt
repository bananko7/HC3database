How does zipping a file work ? How is it possible to compress a file , and then later expand it , without any changes to the quality of the file ? Explain like I'm five.<>Most information is redundant . Most information is redundant .<>When you \"zip\" a file, you are basically taking a bunch of files and compressing them into one single file. Think of it like taking a bunch of clothes and putting them into a vacuum seal bag. When you do that, the clothes take up less space because the air has been removed from the bag. Similarly, when you zip a file, you are removing unnecessary data from the file, which makes it take up less space on your computer or phone.\n\nTo \"unzip\" a file, you are basically just taking the compressed file and expanding it back to its original size. It's like taking the vacuum seal bag of clothes and opening it back up, and the clothes will be exactly the same as they were before you put them in the bag. The quality of the files should not be affected when you zip and unzip them, as long as you do it correctly.<>reddit_eli5
