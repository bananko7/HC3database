What causes pain in back side of the ribs after an injury?my lower left back around the back of my ribs has a sharp speratic pain. it has slightly eased since the first time it was hit and injured. i was wondering if it could be a cracked rib or what it may be as it still hurts when i sit or stretch in certain ways.<>HelloYes this may be one or more cracked ribs or it could even be a fracture in a transverse process of a vertebraNeither of those usually requires any treatment like surgery but it would be a good idea to see a doctor and get both rib x-rays and a spinal x-ray series<>Pain in the back side of the ribs after an injury could potentially be caused by a cracked or bruised rib. It's also possible that the pain is being caused by muscle strains or sprains in the area. In some cases, the pain may be due to internal injuries or other underlying medical conditions.\n\nTo determine the cause of your pain, it's important to see a doctor for an evaluation. They will be able to perform an examination, ask you about your symptoms, and possibly order imaging tests to help diagnose the issue. Based on the results of the evaluation, the doctor will be able to recommend appropriate treatment.\n\nIn the meantime, it's important to take care of yourself and avoid activities that may worsen the pain. This may include avoiding strenuous activities, applying ice to the area, and taking over-the-counter pain medication as needed. Avoiding activities that put pressure on the injured area, such as lifting heavy objects or participating in contact sports, can also help to prevent further injury.<>medicine
