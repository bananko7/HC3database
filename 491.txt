Why does a computer only last at most 4 or 5 years ? Why ca n't a computer last forever ? I understand that everything has an expiration date I 'm just wondering about the specifics of home computers only lasting a couple years . Explain like I'm five.<>Computers can last as long as you want them to provided you take care of them . The issue is that computers become obsolete very quickly . Technology advances at a significant pace and computers are built to take advantage of these advances .<>Computers are made up of many different components, and each of those components has a limited lifespan. Some of those components, like the hard drive or the battery, can wear out over time with use. Others, like the processor or the memory, can become outdated as technology advances and newer, more powerful components become available. Because of these limitations, computers typically don't last forever. However, with proper care and maintenance, you can often extend the lifespan of your computer by keeping it clean, making sure it has adequate ventilation, and using it in a way that doesn't put too much strain on its components. It's also worth noting that the average lifespan of a computer can vary depending on the type of computer and how it's used. For example, a desktop computer that is used infrequently and has a high-quality power supply may last longer than a laptop that is used heavily and has a lower-quality power supply.<>reddit_eli5
