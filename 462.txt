Why do we call our parents mom and dad and not by their first names ? Same thing with uncle and aunt . Also why do n't we call our wife ' wife ' or boyfriend ' boyfriend ' ? Please explain like I'm five.<>I 'm no wordologist , but I 'd guess it 's because their title is more important than their name and there 's only one of each . I do call my aunts and uncles by their first name , like \" Uncle Stephen \" \" Aunt Doris , \" etc . because there are ( and even if there are n't there can be ) more than one of each . Your partner only gains their title after getting to know them , so their title is n't primary .<>These terms of address are known as \"kinship terms\" and they are used to describe the relationships between people in a family. The terms \"mom\" and \"dad\" are used to refer to a person's parents, and \"uncle\" and \"aunt\" are used to refer to a person's siblings. Using kinship terms is a way to show respect and affection for the people we are related to. It is also a way to distinguish between different family members, especially when there are many people in a family and it can be confusing to keep track of who is who. As for the terms \"wife\" and \"boyfriend,\" these are more specific terms that describe a person's romantic relationship with another person. In general, it is more common to use these terms to refer to someone in a more formal or public setting, rather than in a family setting. In a family setting, it is more common to use terms of affection and endearment, such as \"honey\" or \"sweetheart,\" rather than more formal terms like \"wife\" or \"boyfriend.\"<>reddit_eli5
