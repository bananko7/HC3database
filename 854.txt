How do the reproductive systems of female mammals that have full litters of offspring differ from human reproductive systems ? What enables them to have so many offspring at once ? Explain like I'm five.<>They ovulate multiple eggs at once . Large mammals , such as humans , elephants , rhinos , whales , horses , cows , etc ... usually ovulate one egg at a time .<>In female mammals that have full litters of offspring, their reproductive systems are adapted to produce and carry multiple offspring at once. This is different from the human reproductive system, which is adapted to produce and carry only one offspring at a time. One key difference between the reproductive systems of these mammals and humans is the number of eggs that are released during ovulation. In humans, only one egg is released each month, while in mammals with full litters, many eggs are released at once. This allows the female to become pregnant with multiple offspring at the same time. Another difference is the size and structure of the uterus, which is the organ where the baby grows and develops. In humans, the uterus is small and only has enough room for one baby. In mammals with full litters, the uterus is larger and has multiple compartments, allowing it to hold and nourish multiple babies at once. Finally, the duration of pregnancy is often shorter in mammals with full litters compared to humans. This allows the babies to be born at a stage of development when they are better able to survive on their own. Overall, the reproductive systems of female mammals that have full litters of offspring are adapted to produce and carry multiple offspring at once, which enables them to have so many offspring at once.<>reddit_eli5
