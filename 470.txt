Cases in language .. Accusative , nominative , dative , genitive , etc . I 've been trying to learn German recently and ca n't get my head around these concepts .. Explain like I'm five.<>Cases are sort of like tenses for nouns . They indicate the role the noun is playing in a sentence . The explanations I 'm about to give are from Latin , so there may be slight differences . Nominative indicates that the noun is the subject of a verb ( it 's doing something ) . In Latin , for example , we might write \" Quint**us * * cenam parat \" ( \" Quintus prepares \/ is preparing dinner \" ) with the * -us * ending indicating the nominative . * Quintus * is the subject of the verb * parat * . Accusative indicates that the noun is the direct object of a verb ( something is being done * to * it ) . In the above sentence , \" cen**am * * \" , with the * -am * indicating accusative case , indicates that \" cenam \" ( ' dinner ' ) is the object of the verb \" parat \" ( prepare ) . Dative is like accusative , but for indirect objects . Indirect objects indicate * how * a verb does its action . For example , in the sentence \" Joe threw the ball to Steve \" , Joe is the subject ( nominative ) , the ball is the direct object ( accusative ) , and Steve indicates the manner in which the ball was thrown ( dative ) . Genitive indicates either possession or relationship . For example , the Catholic phrase \" in nomine patris \" ( in the name of the father ) has \" patris \" ( father ) in the genitive case . It 's the father 's ( patris ) name ( nomine ) , the name is described or qualified by the father . It can also just mean possession : Quintus ' dinner = \" cena quinti \" , cena = dinner ( nominative ) , quinti = of or relating to Quintus ( genitive ) .<>Sure! In grammar, the case of a noun or pronoun tells you how it is being used in a sentence. Here are some of the most common cases:\r\n\r\nNominative: This is the case used for the subject of a verb. For example, in the sentence \"I am eating an apple,\" \"I\" is the subject of the verb \"am eating,\" so it is in the nominative case.\r\n\r\nAccusative: This is the case used for the direct object of a verb. In the sentence \"I am eating an apple,\" \"apple\" is the direct object of the verb \"am eating,\" so it is in the accusative case.\r\n\r\nDative: This is the case used to show the indirect object of a verb, which is the noun or pronoun that receives something. For example, in the sentence \"I gave my friend a gift,\" \"friend\" is the indirect object of the verb \"gave,\" so it is in the dative case.\r\n\r\nGenitive: This is the case used to show possession or ownership. For example, in the sentence \"This is my friend's book,\" \"friend's\" is in the genitive case because it shows that the book belongs to the friend.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps!
