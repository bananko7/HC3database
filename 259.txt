Why do characters in films and in television shows always have a mock - up operating system on their computers , and never use a real internet browser ? This one puzzles me . Explain like I'm five.<>If you used a * real * browser \/ operating system , then you 're bound by * real * performance and behaviour . Everything would take twice as long , because you have to wiggle your mouse around , click buttons , change settings , type instructions , wait for results to appear , etc . All of those actions take precious seconds to perform , and seconds for the system to respond . By having a mockup OS ( which is really more like a video file on autoplay ) , it does exactly what you want it to , in any order you choose , at any speed you like .<>Characters in films and television shows often use mock-up operating systems and internet browsers for a few reasons.\n\nFirst, using a real operating system or internet browser might not look as visually interesting on screen. A mock-up operating system or internet browser can be designed to look a certain way and can include special features or graphics that help tell the story or make the scene more exciting.\n\nSecond, using a real operating system or internet browser might not allow the filmmakers to show certain things that they want to show. For example, they might want to show a character accessing a particular website or file that they don't have permission to use in real life.\n\nFinally, using a real operating system or internet browser might be more expensive or time-consuming for the filmmakers. Creating a mock-up operating system or internet browser can be easier and more cost-effective than using a real one.<>reddit_eli5
