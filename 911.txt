Why are dog years shorter than human years ? How accurate is that really ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Dog years is made up . Dogs just have a shorter life span<>Dog years are not actually shorter than human years, it's just a way to compare the ages of dogs to humans. Dogs age faster than humans, so when we say that a dog is seven years old in \"dog years,\" it means that the dog is the same age as a seven-year-old human. To figure out a dog's age in \"dog years,\" you can use a simple formula: just multiply the dog's actual age by 7. For example, if a dog is 4 years old, it would be 4 x 7 = 28 years old in \"dog years.\" It's important to note that this is just a rough estimate, and different breeds of dogs age at different rates. Some dogs may age more slowly or quickly than others, so the \"dog years\" formula might not be completely accurate for every dog. But overall, the \"dog years\" formula is a good way to compare the ages of dogs to humans and to get a rough idea of how old a dog is in human terms.<>reddit_eli5
