trailing stop loss in slow price decline<>The price doesn't have to drop 5% in one go to activate your order. The trailing aspect simply means your sell trigger price will increase if the current value increases (it will never decrease).<>A trailing stop loss is a type of order that adjusts the stop loss price of a trade as the trade moves in the trader's favor. It is designed to protect profits and limit losses.In a slow price decline, a trailing stop loss can be used to protect profits by setting the stop loss at a certain percentage or dollar amount below the market price. As the market price falls, the stop loss will also be adjusted to the new market price, ensuring that the trade will be closed if the price continues to fall and reaches the stop loss level. This can be a useful strategy for traders who want to lock in profits while still allowing some room for the trade to potentially recover.It's important to note that a trailing stop loss is not a guarantee that a trade will be closed at the desired price. The market may gap or the price may move too quickly for the stop loss to be triggered, in which case the trade could be closed at a worse price. It's always a good idea to carefully consider the potential risks and rewards of any trading strategy before implementing it.<>finance
