Why is there so little interest in space by the general public or media ? Considering the sheer magnitude of discovery to be made and just how downright awe inspiring it is . It 's like all interest stops at fictional representations in movies and games . Please explain like I'm five.<>Cause you spend billions and ordinary folk see almost no result . Great we landed another rover on mars ! How does that help me keep warm in the winter and feed my kids ?<>One reason there might be less interest in space exploration by the general public or media is because it can be expensive and time-consuming. Sending people and things into space requires a lot of resources and planning, and the process of exploring space can be slow. It can also be difficult for people to understand or relate to what is happening in space because it is so far away and hard to visualize. Finally, there are many other topics and issues that people are interested in and that the media covers, so space exploration might not always get as much attention as other things.<>reddit_eli5
