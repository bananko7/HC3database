Allergies can also cause these symptoms, as well as irritation from exposure to irritants such as tobacco smoke or air pollution.\n\nThe crusting of the eyes that you describe could be caused by a condition called conjunctivitis, which is an inflammation of the thin, clear tissue that lines the inside of the eyelid and covers the white part of the eye. Conjunctivitis can be caused by a viral or bacterial infection, allergies, or exposure to irritants. It can also be a symptom of another underlying condition, such as dry eye or blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelid).\n\nIt's important to see a healthcare provider if you are experiencing persistent or severe symptoms, or if you have any concerns about your health. They can help determine the cause of your symptoms and recommend appropriate treatment.<>medicine
