How do photographers make the sun \/ moon look massive ? [ Like this ] ( URL_0 ) Explain like I'm five.<>Simply by zooming in with powerful lenses on far away objects . Think about the size of the moon relative to other objects on the far horizon- a tree may appear to be the same size of the moon if it 's far enough away from you . Now , simply zoom in on that scene and the moon will appear gigantic .<>To make the sun or moon look larger in a photograph, the photographer can use a technique called \"forced perspective.\" This involves positioning the camera in such a way that the sun or moon appears larger in relation to other objects in the scene.\n\nFor example, if the photographer wants to make the sun look larger, they might position the camera closer to the sun and farther away from other objects in the scene. This causes the sun to appear larger in the photograph because it takes up more space in the frame.\n\nAnother way to make the sun or moon look larger is to use a lens with a long focal length. A long focal length lens has a narrow field of view, which means that it zooms in on a smaller area of the scene. This can make the sun or moon appear larger in the photograph because it takes up more of the frame.\n\nFinally, the photographer can use post-processing techniques to adjust the size and position of the sun or moon in the photograph. This can involve using software to crop the photograph or to adjust the size and position of the sun or moon using tools like the clone stamp or the healing brush.\n\nOverall, making the sun or moon look larger in a photograph requires a combination of techniques, including careful camera placement, lens choice, and post-processing.<>reddit_eli5
