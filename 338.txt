Why does a ETN that is supposed to track Crude Oil like UWTI show constant decline every year? And am I an idiot for investing in it?<>This security looks like it will require patience for it to pay off. The 200 day moving average looks as if it will soon cross over the 20 day moving average. When that happens the security can be said to be in a bull run.  http:\/\/stockcharts.com\/h-sc\/ui?s=UWTI&p=D&yr=1&mn=6&dy=0&id=p10888728027 However, this is just speculation... trying to make money via 'buy low, sell high' as I have stated previously, you have about a 25% chance of buying at the low and selling at the high. Better to buy into a fund that pays dividends and reinvest those dividends. Such as: http:\/\/www.dividend.com\/dividend-stocks\/uncategorized\/other\/pgf-invesco-powershares-financial-preferred-portfolio\/ http:\/\/stockcharts.com\/h-sc\/ui?s=PGF&p=D&yr=1&mn=6&dy=0&id=p59773821284<>There are a number of factors that can contribute to the performance of an exchange-traded note (ETN) such as the United States Oil Fund (UWTI), which is designed to track the price of crude oil. Some of the factors that can affect the value of an ETN like UWTI include:Market conditions: The price of crude oil is influenced by a wide range of market forces, including supply and demand, economic conditions, and geopolitical events. If these factors cause the price of crude oil to decline, the value of an ETN that tracks crude oil may also decline.Fees and expenses: ETNs typically charge fees to cover their expenses, which can eat into the return on the investment. If the fees and expenses of an ETN are high, it may underperform compared to other investment options.Credit risk: ETNs are issued by financial institutions, which means that there is a risk that the issuer could default on its obligations. If the issuer of an ETN experiences financial difficulty, it could negatively impact the value of the ETN.It is not necessarily the case that an ETN like UWTI will always show a constant decline every year. The performance of an ETN will depend on a variety of factors, and it is important to carefully consider these factors before making an investment. It is not uncommon for the value of an investment to fluctuate over time, and it is important to be prepared for the possibility of both gains and losses. It is not necessarily the case that you are an idiot for investing in an ETN like UWTI, but it is important to carefully consider your investment goals, risk tolerance, and other relevant factors before making any investment decisions.<>finance
