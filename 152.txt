How did a single meteor ( if that 's true ) wipe out the majority of dinosaurs . I ca n't fathom it . Explain like I'm five.<>Experts correct me if I 'm wrong but from my understanding , the theory goes : A 10 km wide meteor strikes the earth and the ash cloud blocks out the sun for a year and reduces sunlight reaching the earth for ~10 years . Plant life is massively reduced , megatsunamis are created and firestorms rage on due to the high O2 content . Fire increases the C02 content in the atmosphere and causes a temporary greenhouse effect . Acid rain also happens due to the nature of the land material of the impact location . Food chains collapse and large organisms die out due to the lack of sustenance . Dinosaurs eventually die out and pave the way for smaller organisms to establish dominance .<>A meteor is a big rock that falls from space and lands on Earth. Many millions of years ago, a very large meteor crashed into Earth and caused a lot of damage. The impact of the meteor was so strong that it caused a huge explosion and a lot of dust and debris was sent into the air. This dust and debris blocked out the sunlight, which made it hard for plants to grow. Without plants, the dinosaurs that ate plants couldn't find enough food to eat, and they died. Some dinosaurs that ate other animals might have survived for a little while longer, but they eventually died too because there wasn't enough food for them to eat. The meteor impact was a disaster for the dinosaurs, and it caused many of them to go extinct.<>reddit_eli5
