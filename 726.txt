Why \" www . \" is 100 % necessary in this situation For an example : - URL_0 does n't work - www . URL_0 works Why is this ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Whoever has the URL_1 domain does n't have a DNS record set for ` URL_1 ` or ` * . URL_1 ` but does have a DNS record set for ` URL_0 ` . No record , no lookup . Or , they have ` URL_1 ` set to not host a web server . Edit : they have a web server , it is n't the same web server as URL_0 .<>The \"www\" in a web address stands for \"World Wide Web.\" It's a part of the domain name that is used to identify websites on the internet. Some websites can be accessed with or without the \"www\" in the address, but in many cases, the \"www\" is necessary in order to access the website. \nFor example, if you type \"URL_0\" into your web browser, it might not be able to find the website because it doesn't know where to look. But if you type \"www.URL_0,\" your web browser will know to look for the website on the World Wide Web. \nThink of it like trying to send a letter to someone. If you don't include the address of where the letter should go, the post office won't know where to deliver it. But if you include the full address, including the street name and house number, the post office will know exactly where to deliver the letter. The \"www\" in a web address is like the street name and house number in an address â€“ it helps your web browser find the website you're trying to visit.<>reddit_eli5
