Are all VISA cards connected with bank accounts?<>Not necessarily. You can issue credit cards without a bank involved, although companies which do so may have additional legal complications, such as usury regulations. As an example, AmEx is a network which also issues cards themselves. The company is not a bank; they sold their banking subsidiary in 2007. It's also possible to get a bank-issued credit card without banking with that same company.<>Yes, all Visa cards are connected to bank accounts. Visa is a type of payment card that is issued by banks and financial institutions. It allows cardholders to make purchases, pay bills, and withdraw cash from ATMs using their bank account funds. Visa cards are accepted at millions of merchants and ATMs worldwide, and they offer a variety of features and benefits depending on the specific card and issuing bank. Some Visa cards are linked to checking or savings accounts, while others may be connected to credit accounts or prepaid accounts. In all cases, however, the cardholder must have a bank account in order to obtain and use a Visa card.<>finance
