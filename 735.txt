How long did it take for Americans to lose their European accents when migrating to America ? Why did different accents pick up in different regions ? I often watch Westerns and wonder if people back then still had their European accents . Explain like I'm five.<>If you 're talking general accent , the British founders of America never lost theirs . It was the Brits back in England who did . Modern American accents in the northeast , particularly Boston and New York , are much closer to how the English spoke at the time America was first settled . As for later , non - English speaking immigrants , the accents most likely went away in a generation or two , as their children and grandchildren learned English as native speakers . Keep in mind , though , that immigration from Europe was ongoing and , in certain parts of the country in the mid and late 19th century ( like Missouri and Kansas ) , you could have heard a lot of people with German accents , for example . Tiny mind - blower for you : Queen Victoria did not have a British accent , since her first language was German ...<>It's important to note that not all Americans have European ancestry, so not all Americans have or have had European accents. However, for those who did have European ancestry and migrated to America, it would depend on how long they had been in America and how much they interacted with other people who spoke English with a different accent. In general, it takes a while for a person's accent to change, and it may never change completely.\r\n\r\nDifferent accents developed in different regions of America because people from different parts of the world settled in different parts of the country. For example, people from England, Ireland, and Scotland settled in the eastern part of the United States, so the accent in that region is influenced by those countries. People from Germany and other European countries settled in the midwestern United States, so the accent in that region is influenced by those countries. Similarly, people from Spain and other Latin American countries settled in the southwestern United States, so the accent in that region is influenced by those countries.\r\n\r\nIt's also worth noting that many people in the past were multilingual and could speak more than one language, so it's possible that some people who migrated to America spoke English with an accent that was influenced by their native language.\r\n\r\nSo, to answer your question, it would have taken some time for people who migrated to America to lose their European accents, if they did at all. Different accents developed in different regions of the country because different groups of people settled in those regions.<>reddit_eli5
