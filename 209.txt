why is it that people with a stutter can sing flawlessly but ca n't piece simple sentences together easily ? Thought about this due to American Idol contestant . Explain like I'm five.<>( what i think , having had a stutter for the first few years of my life ) . stuttering really happens when you are talking as the words you want to say come to mind . going from the brain to the mouth , you trip up a little bit . there 's a little bit of a break in the connection . but if you memorized what you need to say , it is much easier because you know what to say next . hope this helped !<>People with a stutter, also known as stuttering, may have difficulty speaking smoothly and fluently when they are speaking naturally, but they may be able to sing more fluently because singing involves a different set of muscles and processes in the brain than speaking does.\n\nWhen we speak, we use the muscles in our mouth, tongue, and throat to produce sounds and form words. Stuttering can occur when there is a problem with the coordination or control of these muscles, which can cause disruptions in the flow of speech.\n\nSinging, on the other hand, involves using the muscles in our diaphragm, chest, and stomach to produce sound, as well as the muscles in our mouth, tongue, and throat to shape the sound into words and melodies. These muscles may work differently than the muscles used for speaking, which can make it easier for someone with a stutter to sing more fluently.\n\nIt's also possible that the rhythm and structure of singing may help someone with a stutter to speak more fluently, as the regular beat and melody of a song can provide a framework for producing sound and words. However, this is not always the case, as stuttering can affect different people in different ways.<>reddit_eli5
