But now that they have been invented, many cars do have them. Some cars have them built in to the dashboard or center console, and some have them as options that you can add on. However, not all cars have them because it can be expensive to add them. Some car manufacturers might decide that it's not worth the cost to add them to all of their cars, especially if they are trying to keep the price of the car low. It's also important to remember that cars are designed to do a lot of different things. They need to be safe, reliable, and efficient, and adding things like USB ports and power plugs can make the car more complex and harder to design. This is why not all cars have them, even though it might seem like a good idea to have them.<>reddit_eli5
