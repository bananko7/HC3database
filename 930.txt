Why does my wifi stop working when my microwave is turned on ? For the most part it 's my wireless devices like laptops , PC 's and phones.etc . Please explain like I'm five.<>Your microwave is leaking microwaves , disrupting the device 's wireless signal . It should n't be doing that .<>Microwaves and Wi-Fi operate on similar frequencies, which can cause interference when they are used at the same time. This can cause your Wi-Fi to stop working or to work less efficiently when your microwave is turned on. It's a bit like trying to have two conversations on the same phone line at the same time. It can be difficult to hear what either person is saying because the sounds are mixed together. Similarly, when the microwave and Wi-Fi signals mix together, it can be difficult for your devices to \"hear\" the Wi-Fi signal, which can cause problems with your internet connection.<>reddit_eli5
