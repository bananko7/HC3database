Why do n't we breathe in fully ( deeply ) with every breath ? Just curious and thought of this when I was falling asleep . Why do we tend to breathe in at only half lung capacity ? Please explain like I'm five.<>At rest the body does not require a lot of oxygen . It would be a waste of energy to expand the lungs fully each time we took a breath . Also try taking multiple deep breaths at a time , you 'll start to feel quite light headed !<>Great question! When we take a deep breath, we are actually filling our lungs to their maximum capacity, which is called \"total lung capacity.\" However, we don't always need to take in this much air, especially when we are at rest or doing light activities. Taking in smaller breaths and only filling our lungs partially is called \"partial lung capacity,\" and it's a way for our bodies to conserve energy. Think about it this way: when you take a deep breath, your body has to work harder to fill your lungs with air and then to push the air back out again. This requires more energy, and if you were to take deep breaths all the time, it could be tiring. By only taking in partial breaths, we use less energy and still get enough oxygen to meet our body's needs. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.<>reddit_eli5
