why is it considered dangerous to use your cell phone near an operating gas pump ? I 've never really understood it . Please explain like I'm five.<>It 's not dangerous . It 's a myth that has been disproven . Actually Mythbusters did an episode on it and they laughed it was so wrong .<>It's considered dangerous to use your cell phone near an operating gas pump because cell phones can produce sparks, and if you are using your phone near a gas pump, the spark could potentially ignite the gasoline vapors that are present in the air. This could cause a fire or even an explosion. It's important to be safe when using a gas pump, and one way to do that is to make sure to turn off your phone or keep it away from the gas pump while you are fueling your vehicle.<>reddit_eli5
