Working as a freelancer overseas, but US Citizen, what is my tax situation?
This person must pay taxes in both the overseas country and in the U.S. This is unusual; generally, only the U.S. demands this. Depending on the specific country, he would likely not be taxed twice as the U.S. generally recognises tax paid in a different country. Note there are some gotchas, though. For example, although Canada has a generally higher tax scheme than the U.S., you may still end up owing tax if you use the Tax-Free Savings Account system in Canada, as that is not recognised in the U.S. As to whether or not this person should form a company, that is far too broad a question. It's going to depend in large part on the tax situations of the countries involved. This person needs to consult an accountant specialising in this situation. That is, on personal versus business tax and on tax involving U.S. citizens. Yes, this person can and indeed must file and pay taxes in the U.S., from outside the U.S.
As a US citizen, you are required to pay taxes on your worldwide income, regardless of where you reside or where you earned the income. This means that if you are working as a freelancer overseas, you will need to report your income on your US tax return and pay taxes on that income.There are a few things to consider when it comes to your tax situation as a freelancer overseas:Foreign Earned Income Exclusion: If you meet certain requirements, you may be able to exclude up to $107,600 (for tax year 2021) of your foreign earned income from your US taxable income. To qualify for the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion, you must meet either the \"bona fide residence test\" or the \"physical presence test.\"Foreign Tax Credit: If you are required to pay taxes on your foreign income in the country where you are working, you may be able to claim a foreign tax credit on your US tax return to offset some or all of the taxes you paid to the foreign country.Self-Employment Taxes: As a freelancer, you are responsible for paying self-employment taxes (Social Security and Medicare taxes) on your earnings. However, you may be able to claim a credit for foreign social security taxes paid if you are required to pay them in the foreign country where you are working.It's important to keep good records of your income and expenses as a freelancer, as you will need to report this information on your tax return. You may also want to consider consulting with a tax professional to ensure that you are complying with all applicable tax laws and to help you take advantage of any tax credits or exclusions for which you may be eligible.
