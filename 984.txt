With the Earth spinning at roughly 1000 mph , how the hell can we see stars and other far away objects ? Should n't everything just be a blur ? This is a stupid question , but I 've been wanting to ask for a while . Please explain like I'm five.<>because of the relative size of earth , that 1000 mph ( I did n't check for accuracy - sounds close enough ) is not much angular change . Since it takes the Earth around 24 Hrs to rotate , each hr at the equator is around 1000 Mi \/ hr , or 16 Mi \/ min . Focusing on something far away .. the moon is around 240,000 miles - means even over a minute , it is a mighty small change . Observable , probably at that distance .. but even the Sun is millions of miles away . Imagine a triangle with the sun at the apex , each leg is 92 million miles long , and the base is your position over time .. 16 miles is pretty close to zero , when measuring millions of miles otherwise . It illustrates that we barely move at all in comparison to the distance away .<>Even though the Earth is spinning very quickly, it is still possible to see far away objects like stars because they are so far away from us. Imagine you are on a very long car ride, and you are looking out the window at the trees and houses passing by. Even though the car is moving quickly, you are still able to see the trees and houses clearly because they are relatively close to you. In the same way, even though the Earth is spinning quickly, we are still able to see the stars clearly because they are so far away from us.<>reddit_eli5
