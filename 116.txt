Suggest treatment for hole and pain in penisHi, within the past few days I have noticed a shallow hole to the left of my frenulum. It has grown increasingly painful and is a constant pain that I feel in the entire area. It stings whenever I move my bottom lip too much and seems to have gotten bigger. I am really worried about it and have no idea what to do. thanks.<>Thanks for asking in healthcaremagic forumIn short: it may be a tearExplanation: If you are experiencing pain\/burning sensation then most probably it is tear of frenulum. So, start applying oint soframycin over there and give rest for healing. If it heals then no problem otherwise visit a doctor after 2-3 days.                  Hope this helps you, please let me know.<>I'm sorry to hear about the pain and the hole in your penis. It's important to see a healthcare provider as soon as possible to determine the cause of the hole and the pain and to receive proper treatment. This is especially important because the penis is a sensitive area and any changes or abnormalities should be evaluated promptly.\n\nIt's not possible for me to diagnose the cause of the hole and the pain or to recommend a specific treatment without examining you in person and obtaining more information about your symptoms and medical history. Only a healthcare provider can do that.\n\nI recommend that you make an appointment to see a healthcare provider as soon as possible. In the meantime, try to avoid sexual activity and avoid any activities that might irritate the area. Wearing loose-fitting, comfortable clothing may also help to reduce irritation.\n\nI hope this information is helpful. If you have any more questions or concerns, don't hesitate to ask.<>medicine
