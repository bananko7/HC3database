Why would a company like Apple be buying back its own shares?<>I think JB King's answer is interesting from the point of view of \"is this good for me\" but the OP's question boils down to \"why would a company do this?\" The company buys back shares when it thinks it will better position the company financially. A Simple Scenario: If Company A wants to open a new store, for example, they need to buy the land, build the store, stock it, etc, etc and this all costs money.  The company can get a loan, use accrued capital, or raise new capital by issuing new stock.  Each method has benefits and drawbacks. One of the drawbacks of issuing new stock is that it dilutes the existing stock's value.  Previously, total company profits were split between x shares.  Now the profits are shared between x+y shares, where y is the number of new shares issued to raise the capital. This normally drives the price of the stock down, since the expected future dividends per stock have decreased. Now the company has a problem: the next time they go to raise money by issuing stock, they will have to issue MORE shares to get the same value - leading to more dilution.  To break out of this cycle, the company can buy back shares periodically.  When the company feels the the stock is sufficiently undervalued, it buys some back.  Now the profits are shared with a smaller pool, and the stock price goes up, and the next time Company A needs to raise capital, it can issue stock. So it probably has little to do with rewarding shareholders, and more to do with lowering the \"cost of capital\" for the company in the future.<>There are a few reasons why a company like Apple might buy back its own shares:To increase the value of the remaining shares: When a company buys back its own shares, it reduces the total number of outstanding shares on the market. This can lead to an increase in the value of the remaining shares, as each share represents a larger portion of the company's ownership.To return value to shareholders: Some companies use share buybacks as a way to return value to shareholders, especially when they have excess cash on hand and do not have any immediate plans for it. Share buybacks can be a way for companies to distribute profits to shareholders without actually paying dividends.To improve financial ratios: Buying back shares can also improve a company's financial ratios, such as its price-to-earnings ratio and its earnings per share. This can make the company more attractive to investors and potentially increase the value of its stock.To reduce the risk of a hostile takeover: By buying back its own shares, a company can make it more difficult for another company or individual to gain a controlling stake in the company. This can help the company maintain its independence and protect itself from a hostile takeover.<>There are a few reasons why a company like Apple might buy back its own shares:To increase the value of the remaining shares: When a company buys back its own shares, it reduces the total number of outstanding shares on the market.
