ELI15 : How did ' cum ' rather than ' come ' become the coloquial spelling for ejaculate ? NSFW I guess ? See above Explain like I'm five.<>Someone spells it wrong then it catches on , like many changes in language . [ Specific info on the etymology of ' cum ' . ] ( URL_0 )<>It's not uncommon for people to spell words differently in casual or informal writing, and \"cum\" is an example of this. The word \"cum\" is short for \"come,\" which is a verb that means to reach a particular point or state, or to arrive at a location. In the context of sexual activity, \"come\" can also refer to ejaculating, or the release of semen from the penis during orgasm. \"Cum\" is often used as a slang term in this context. It's not clear exactly how or why \"cum\" came to be used as a slang term for ejaculate, but it's possible that it may have originated as a shortened or altered form of the word \"come.\" It's also worth noting that \"cum\" is not considered to be a proper or standard spelling of the word, and it should be avoided in formal writing.<>reddit_eli5
