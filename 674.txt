Gym membership tax deductible?<>Assuming its in the US: No, it is not, and such things are usually treated as \"red flags\" for audit (and no, golf club memberships are not deductible either). The food expenses are not deductible in their entirety as well, only up to 50% of the actual expense, and only if it is directly business related. From what you've described, it sounds like if you have an audit coming you'll be in trouble. The purposes and activities of a club, not its name, will determine   whether or not you can deduct the dues. You cannot deduct dues paid   to: Country clubs, Golf and athletic clubs, Airline clubs, Hotel clubs, and Clubs operated to provide meals under circumstances generally considered to be conducive to business discussions.<>In general, gym memberships are not tax deductible. However, there are a few exceptions where the cost of a gym membership might be tax deductible.If you are self-employed and use the gym as a place to conduct business meetings or as a place to work out during your lunch break, you may be able to deduct the cost of your gym membership as a business expense. However, you will need to be able to demonstrate that the gym membership is primarily used for business purposes and that the cost is reasonable.If you have a doctor's note recommending that you join a gym or participate in a particular exercise program for medical reasons, you may be able to claim the cost of your gym membership as a medical expense on your tax return. In this case, the gym membership must be part of a treatment plan prescribed by a doctor and must be used to treat a specific medical condition.It's important to note that in order to claim a deduction for a gym membership or any other expense, you must itemize your deductions on your tax return. This means you will need to use Form 1040, Schedule A to claim the deduction.I recommend consulting with a tax professional or reviewing the IRS guidelines for more information on what expenses are tax deductible.<>finance
