Worm Holes I 'm watching \" How the Universe Works \" on the Science channel right now and they mentioned worm holes . I understand what they are .. but how do they actually work ? Explain like I'm five.<>You bend the universe as if it was a piece of paper and stick a hole in the paper \/ universe . Travel through to go from one place to another faster . I do n't know how to tear a hole in the fabric of the universe ... Yet .<>Wormholes are hypothetical shortcuts through space-time that could allow matter or information to travel from one point in the universe to another point in a very short amount of time. Imagine you have a flat sheet of paper and you want to get to the other side of the paper quickly. Instead of crawling over the top of the paper, you could just poke a hole through the paper and crawl through the hole to the other side. A wormhole is like that, but instead of a flat piece of paper, it's the three-dimensional space we live in, and instead of crawling through a hole, you're traveling through a tunnel through space and time. There is no scientific evidence that wormholes actually exist, and many scientists think they are highly unlikely to be real. However, the idea of wormholes is still interesting to scientists because it could potentially help us understand how the universe works and how we could potentially travel long distances in a very short amount of time.<>reddit_eli5
