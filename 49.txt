This penalty is often referred to as a prepayment penalty or a prepayment fee.Prepayment penalties are designed to compensate the lender for the interest that they would have received if the borrower had made all of the scheduled loan payments. The lender may charge a fee to cover the lost interest. Prepayment penalties are often stated as a percentage of the outstanding loan balance at the time of prepayment.Prepayment penalties may be triggered if you pay off your personal loan before the end of the loan term. Some loans may allow you to make extra payments or pay off the loan early without a penalty, but this is not always the case.
