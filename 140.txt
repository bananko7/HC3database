How can two identical phones on the same cell plan with similar storage sit next to each other , one with LTE reception , the other with 1x ? Do individual phones have different capacities to receive cell coverage from the same tower ? Explain like I'm five. <>Check your settings . Cell phones are capable of switching off higher power consuming receivers in order to save battery .<>There can be a few different reasons why two phones on the same cell plan with similar storage and placed next to each other might have different reception. Here are a few possibilities:\\n\\nThe phone with better reception might be closer to the cell tower or have a clearer line of sight to it. Cell towers transmit signals that can be obstructed by buildings, trees, or other physical barriers. If one of the phones is closer to the tower or has a clearer path to it, it will have better reception.\\n\\nThe phone with poorer reception might have a weaker antenna or be using an older or less advanced cellular technology. Some phones are designed with stronger antennas or are able to connect to newer cellular technologies that can provide better coverage. If one of the phones has a weaker antenna or is using an older technology, it might not be able to get as strong of a signal.\\n\\nThere might be interference from other devices or sources. Radio frequency (RF) signals, which are used for cell phone communication, can be disrupted by other devices that use RF signals, such as Wi-Fi routers or microwave ovens. If one of the phones is experiencing interference from another device, it might have poorer reception.\\n\\nOverall, there are many factors that can affect a phone's ability to get good reception, including the phone's design, its distance and line of sight to the cell tower, and any interference it might be experiencing.<>reddit_eli5
