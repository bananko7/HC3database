The ending of Fight Club I get the dynamic between Brad Pitt and Edward Norton , but the final gunshot still does n't make sense to me 13 years after the movie 's release . I am Jack 's confused moviewatcher . Explain like I'm five.<>This is the way I see it : \" Jack \" has to kill himself . He has to kill himself because if he does n't then he will just become the bad guy . He looses control more and more over the course of the movie . He thinks Tyler is out of control and there is n't much he can do to stop him . So he looks at him and says \" My eyes are open \" because he knows that they only way he can end this is by killing both of them . Only he messes up the shot . The reason Tyler dies is because he knows that \" Jack \" was really trying to kill himself with the gun shot . If he still existed , then \" Jack \" would just try to kill himself again . It 's like the ultimate line in the sand ...<>In the movie \"Fight Club,\" the characters played by Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are actually the same person. Norton's character has dissociative identity disorder, which means he has two distinct personalities that are completely separate from each other. The character played by Brad Pitt is one of those personalities, and he is the one who starts the fight club.\n\nAt the end of the movie, Norton's character realizes that he has been fighting against himself the entire time, and he decides to shoot himself in the mouth in order to \"kill\" the other personality. The gunshot represents Norton's character taking control of his own life and choosing to end the conflict within himself.\n\nI hope this helps to clarify the ending of the movie for you. Let me know if you have any other questions.<>reddit_eli5
