The difference between Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. I 'm an uneducated european .. Explain like I'm five.<>The major historical difference between the parties is what they think the purpose of the federal government is . Democrats tend to think that the federal government should take a large role in promoting the welfare of it 's citizens ( so that everyone gets more or less the same treatment ) . Republicans think that the federal government should have a minimal role - mainly to provide infrastructure and defense - and that states should be the ones to take care of their citizens . The assumption there is that different states have different needs , so treating everyone the same is inefficient .<>Republicans and Democrats are two political parties in the United States. They have different beliefs about how the government should run the country.\n\nRepublicans generally believe in smaller government and less taxes. They believe that individuals and businesses should have more freedom and responsibility. They tend to support a strong military and law and order.\n\nDemocrats generally believe in larger government and more services for people. They believe that the government should help take care of people and address social issues. They tend to support more regulation of businesses and a stronger safety net for disadvantaged groups.\n\nBoth parties have their own ideas about what is best for the country, and they often disagree with each other. However, they both want to make the country a better place and they both work to achieve that goal in their own ways.<>reddit_eli5
