Determining current value for real estate for inheritance purposes
how is this new value determined? According to Publication 551: Inherited Property The basis of property inherited from a decedent is generally one of   the following. The FMV of the property at the date of the individual's death. The FMV on the alternate valuation date if the personal representative for the estate chooses to use alternate valuation. For   information on the alternate valuation date, see the Instructions for   Form 706. The value under the special-use valuation method for real property used in farming or a closely held business if chosen for estate tax   purposes. This method is discussed later. FMV is Fair Market Value - which is the price that a willing buyer would pay for the property with reasonable knowledge of all the facts of the property.  The rest generally apply to farmland or other special-purpose land where the amount of income it generates is not properly reflected in the market value. One or more real estate professionals will run \"comps\" that show you recent sales in the same area for similar houses to get a rough estimate of fair market value.   Does it go off of the tax appraised value? Tax assessment may or may not be accurate depending on tax laws (e.g. limits to tax increases) and consistency with the actual market. Should you, prior to your death, get an independent appraiser to appraise the value of the property and include that assessment of the properties value with the will or something? That should not be necessary - another appraisal will likely be done as part of the estate process after death. One reason you might do one is if you are distributing different assets to different heirs, and you want to make sure that the estate is divided equitably.
There are a few steps you can take to determine the current value of real estate for inheritance purposes:Consult with a real estate agent or broker: They can provide you with a comparative market analysis (CMA) of the property, which will give you an idea of what similar properties in the area have recently sold for.Get a professional appraisal: An appraisal is a more in-depth analysis of the property, including its size, condition, and features. A professional appraiser will be able to give you a more accurate estimate of the property's value.Check online resources: There are a number of online resources that can provide you with information on the value of real estate in a particular area, such as Zillow or Redfin. These sites use data on recent sales, as well as other factors, to provide estimates of home values.It's important to keep in mind that the value of real estate can fluctuate over time, so it's a good idea to get a current estimate rather than relying on an old one.
