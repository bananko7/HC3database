In civil court, people or organizations can sue each other over problems with contracts, damages, or other disputes. For example, if someone slips and falls on someone else's property and gets hurt, they might go to civil court to try to get money to pay for their medical bills. Criminal court is for cases where someone is accused of breaking a law. If someone is accused of stealing, hurting someone else, or doing something else that is against the law, they might go to criminal court. In criminal court, the government (usually the police) brings charges against the person, and if they are found guilty, they might go to jail or have to pay a fine. So, in general, civil court is for cases where people or organizations are trying to get money from each other, while criminal court is for cases where someone is accused of breaking a law.<>reddit_eli5
