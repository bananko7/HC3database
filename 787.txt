What allowed humans to safely drink water before purification was invented ? I 'm guessing water purification techniques are a relatively modern technology so I 'm wondering how humans were able to drink water 5000 - 10,000 years ago without getting seriously ill ? Explain like I'm five.<>A ) boiling it B ) making alcoholic drinks with it B ) is the reason that people used to drink a * lot * more in the past - beer was an especially common drink because it was easy to make , not * too * strong , and was safer than water .<>Before modern purification techniques were invented, humans used a variety of methods to make water safe to drink. One of the most common methods was to boil the water, which would kill any harmful bacteria or parasites that might be present. Other methods included filtering the water through sand or other materials to remove impurities, and letting the water sit so that sediment could settle to the bottom. Some people also used chemicals like iodine or chlorine to kill germs in the water.\r\n\r\nAnother way that people were able to drink water safely was by finding sources of water that were naturally pure, such as mountain streams or springs. These sources of water were less likely to contain harmful bacteria or parasites, and so were safer to drink without any additional treatment.\r\n\r\nOverall, it was not always easy for people to find safe drinking water, but by using a combination of these methods and being careful about where they got their water from, they were able to stay healthy and hydrated.<>reddit_eli5
