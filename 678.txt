Why is cat5 wire used for data ? Could regular 18\/2 wire do the same thing ? Since data is just 1s and 0s can you use any kind of wire transmit data ? Explain like I'm five. <>When you start transmitting data at radio frequency ( CAT5 supports up to to 100MHz ) , copper is not just copper and the electrical characteristics of the cable start to limit how much data you can transmit and how far it can propogate . CAT5 is nifty because it has four twisted pairs of conductors ( which minimizes some of the effects of long cabling ) and it 's standard therefore cheap to rely on . So no , you ca n't just use 18\/2 wire . You could if you twisted 8 conductors into pairs , at which point you have a CAT5 cable .<>Yes, you can use any kind of wire to transmit data, but different types of wire are better suited for different tasks. Cat5 wire, which stands for category 5, is a type of twisted pair cable that is commonly used for carrying data. The \"twisted pair\" part of the name refers to the way that the wires inside the cable are arranged: they are twisted together in pairs.\\n\\nThere are a few reasons why cat5 wire is often used for data transmission:\\n\\nIt can transmit data at fast speeds: Cat5 wire is designed to support data transmission speeds of up to 100 megabits per second (Mbps). This is fast enough for many common uses, such as connecting computers to the internet or transmitting video and audio.\\n\\nIt is resistant to interference: The twists in the wire pairs help to cancel out electrical interference from other sources, such as other cables or appliances. This makes cat5 wire more reliable for transmitting data over long distances.\\n\\nIt is relatively cheap: Cat5 wire is relatively inexpensive compared to some other types of data cable, making it a popular choice for many applications.\\n\\nNow, regular 18\/2 wire (which is a type of electrical wire used for household wiring) could technically be used to transmit data, but it is not really designed for that purpose. It is not capable of transmitting data at the same speeds as cat5 wire, and it is more prone to interference from other sources. It would also be more expensive to use 18\/2 wire for data transmission, since you would need to buy more of it to cover the same distance as cat5 wire.\\n\\nSo, to sum up: you can use any kind of wire to transmit data, but different types of wire are better suited for different tasks. Cat5 wire is a good choice for transmitting data at fast speeds over long distances because it is fast, reliable, and inexpensive.<>reddit_eli5
