What can I do to remedy ISA cash\/shares transfer latency?<>One possibility you may consider is to keep all of your funds in the stocks and shares ISA while investing that proportion you wish to keep in cash into a tradeable \"Money Market\" ETF. A Money Market ETF will give you rates comparable to interest rates on cash and at the same time it will give you \"instant access\" subject to normal 3 day settlement of equities.   This is not exactly a perfect solution.  Most Money Market ETFs will pay monthly dividends, so depending on your timing, you may have to give up some interest.  In the worst case, if you were to sell the day before going ex-dividend, then you would be giving up a months interest.  In the best case,  if you were to sell on the day of going ex-dividend, you would be giving up no interest.<>There are a few things you can try to help remedy ISA cash\/shares transfer latency:Check with the ISA provider to see if there are any known issues or delays that may be causing the transfer to be slower than expected.Make sure you have provided all necessary documentation and information to the ISA provider to facilitate the transfer.Consider using a faster payment method, such as a bank transfer or electronic funds transfer, if available.If the transfer is still taking longer than expected, you may want to consider contacting the ISA provider to inquire about the status of the transfer and see if there is anything they can do to speed up the process.I hope this information helps!
