When does a different dialect officially become a new language . With all this talk of \" American \" vs English , I was wondering if and when American could become it 's own language . We already have fairly different words and pronunciations than brittish English . Explain like I'm five.
There is no clear demarcation . Cantonese and Mandarin are different languages in most respects , but the government of China considers them dialects of a single Chinese language . Both views have merits . Languages form large continuua where neighbours can understand each other without problems , but those from opposite ends of the territory often ca n't at all . There 's no clear line where there 's a clean break ; no place where on that side they speak X and on that side Y , except where there 's a national border and both sides insist on conformity to a central standard . However , the oft repeated maxim is that \" a language is a dialect with an army and a navy \" .
