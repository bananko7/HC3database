Hawaii became a state in 1959 . If someone were born in Hawaii in 1958 , would they be allowed to run for President once they reached 35 ? Tell me if my question is worded weirdly or anything , ' k ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Yes , both Alaska and Hawaii were incorporated territories before they were states , so people born there would be natural born citizens .<>Yes, if someone was born in Hawaii in 1958, they would be allowed to run for President once they reach the age of 35. In order to be eligible to be President of the United States, a person must be at least 35 years old and must be a natural-born citizen of the United States.The fact that Hawaii became a state in 1959 does not have any bearing on a person's eligibility to run for President. Being born in one of the 50 states or in the District of Columbia, which is the capital of the United States, is sufficient to meet the requirement of being a natural-born citizen.I hope this helps to clarify things for you! Let me know if you have any other questions.<>reddit_eli5
