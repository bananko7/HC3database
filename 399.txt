4th Dimension What exactly , is the 4th dimension like ? What is a 4th dimensional shape ? Explain like I'm five.<>this guy does it best : [ Carl Sagan ] ( URL_0 )<>The fourth dimension is a concept in mathematics and physics that refers to an extra dimension beyond the three dimensions of space that we are familiar with in our everyday lives. It's a little bit hard to explain exactly what the fourth dimension is like, because it's something that we can't really experience or see directly. In mathematics, we can describe shapes and objects in different dimensions using coordinates. For example, a point in two-dimensional space can be described using two coordinates (x and y), while a point in three-dimensional space can be described using three coordinates (x, y, and z). In the fourth dimension, we would need one more coordinate to describe a point. Just like we can visualize two-dimensional shapes like circles, squares, and triangles in our everyday lives, we can also imagine four-dimensional shapes using our imagination and by using mathematical models. Some examples of four-dimensional shapes might include a four-dimensional cube (also called a \"tesseract\"), a four-dimensional sphere, or a four-dimensional torus (a doughnut-shaped object). These shapes can be difficult to visualize, but we can use math and computer graphics to help us understand what they might look like. I hope that helps!
