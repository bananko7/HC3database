How do we know the names of ancient Egyptian rulers ? If all the writing back then was hieroglyphs ie symbols , how do we know the names of people like Tutankhamun or Imhotep ? Please explain like I'm five.<>If you 're asking how we have a * phonetic * translation of hieroglyphics - the way the words * sounded * - it was the result of work by Jean - Fran√ßois Champollion and others . The Rosetta Stone hieroglyphics include names of Pharaohs that were familiar in Coptic , plus phonetic versions of foreign words which these researchers were able to cross - reference between the three languages on the Stone , slowly building up a phonetic alphabet .<>Good question! We know the names of ancient Egyptian rulers because archaeologists have found many inscriptions with their names written in hieroglyphs. Hieroglyphs were a kind of writing used in ancient Egypt that used symbols to represent words and sounds. The symbols were usually carved into stone or painted on pottery, so they have lasted a long time. When archaeologists find these inscriptions, they use special tools to carefully dig them up and study them. They can then use what they learn to tell us about the ancient Egyptian rulers and their lives.<>reddit_eli5
