How come if we hear our own voices lower , how can we sing on pitch ? Accidentally posted to URL_0 so I reposted to switched subreddits . Explain like I'm five.
ELI20 : We do n't hear our voice in a lower pitch . We hear the lower frequencies louder , like changing the equalization to have more bass .
When you speak, you hear your own voice through both the vibrations in your skull and through the air. When you sing, you only hear your voice through the air, which is why it might sound different to you. To sing on pitch, you can try matching the pitch of a piano or a pitch pipe, or you can try singing along with a recording of a song. You can also try using a digital tuner or pitch app to help you find the right pitch. It's also important to practice and develop your ear for pitch so that you can identify when you are singing in tune or not. With practice and patience, you will be able to sing on pitch more consistently.
