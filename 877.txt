Why do people abuse , torture and savagely eviscerate animals ? You see it every - day I 'm sure , from kids putting kittens in Microwaves , to poachers eviscerating rhino 's . I ca n't fathom why humans do n't have empathy for those animals . Please explain like I'm five.<>Its not just humans . Lots of animals torture each other and other animals for fun .<>There are many different reasons why people might abuse, torture, or harm animals. Some people do it because they are angry, frustrated, or have problems controlling their emotions. Others do it because they think it is funny, or because they want to feel powerful. Some people do it because they have been taught that it is okay to harm animals, while others do it because they do not understand the consequences of their actions. Regardless of the reason, it is important to remember that all living beings deserve to be treated with kindness and respect.<>reddit_eli5
