How does my car go ? The ELI5 's about engines were somewhat helpful but I 'm still lost . What 's happening between my foot pressing down and my car going forward ? Explain like I'm five.<>Combustion engines work by exploding gasoline in tiny amounts . These tiny explosions make expanding gas , which produces a pressure . This is what drives your engine . This pressure makes your engine parts rotate and spin . With gears and mechanical parts , your engine 's spinning parts transfer the rotation into the wheels . By pressing the pedal , you increase the amount of explosions happening , which increases the amount of spinning going on in the engine , which increases the speed your wheels spin at . By using your transmission , you can change the gears and mechanical parts to make your wheels spin faster or slower , with less or more power .<>Sure, I can explain how a car engine works in simple terms. When you press the gas pedal in your car, you are telling the engine to start burning fuel. This fuel is mixed with air and then ignited in the engine's cylinders. The explosion from the ignited fuel pushes a metal rod called a piston. The piston is connected to a system of gears and levers called a crankshaft. The crankshaft converts the up and down movement of the pistons into a rotational movement that can power the wheels of the car.\n\nAs the crankshaft turns, it powers the wheels through a system of belts and gears. The belts and gears in the car's transmission help to adjust the amount of power being sent to the wheels, which is how the car is able to go faster or slower. The wheels of the car are attached to the axles, which are connected to the car's frame. As the crankshaft powers the wheels, the wheels turn and push against the ground, propelling the car forward.\n\nSo, in summary, when you press the gas pedal, you are telling the engine to burn fuel, which powers the pistons and crankshaft, which in turn powers the wheels and moves the car forward. Does that help to clarify things a bit?<>reddit_eli5
