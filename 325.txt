Pyramid schemes . And why they are looked down upon . Kind of explains itself . I always hear them as \" get rich quick \" schemes . Explain like I'm five.<>A pyramid scheme is a business plan that involves making money by recruiting more investors and not by creating a successful product or service , or investing money well . People give you money initially , and then they get paid back with interest , either by them recruiting more people to join your scheme , or by you giving them money from other investors ( a Ponzi scheme ) . For it to work , you have to continually get more members \/ investors . It 's unsustainable because , well , there are only so many people in the world , and eventually there wo n't be anyone else to rope in to your plan , and all of the most recent people who invested will lose their money . That is why they are looked down upon : they can make money , but only by screwing other people out of theirs .<>A pyramid scheme is a type of investment where each person involved recruits others to join. Money made by the new members funnels up to the higher members. The scheme relies on an ever-increasing number of recruits to bring in funds, but eventually, there aren't enough new members to support the upper tiers, and the whole pyramid collapses.\r\n\r\nIn a pyramid scheme, the people at the top make money, while the people at the bottom lose money. This is because there are more people at the bottom than at the top, and as the pyramid gets bigger, it becomes harder and harder for the people at the bottom to make any money.\r\n\r\nPyramid schemes are illegal in many countries because they are fraudulent and rely on constantly recruiting new members to bring in funds, rather than any real investment or sale of products or services. They are often disguised as legitimate investments or business opportunities, but they are not.\r\n\r\nIt's important to be careful and do your research before investing in any opportunity, especially if it seems too good to be true. It's always a good idea to talk to a financial advisor or do your own research before making any investment decisions.<>reddit_eli5
