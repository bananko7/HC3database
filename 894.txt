Please explain what is \"Web Ontology Language\"<>The Web Ontology Language (OWL) is a family of knowledge representation languages for authoring ontologies. Ontologies are a formal way to describe taxonomies and classification networks, essentially defining the structure of knowledge for various domains: the nouns representing classes of objects and the verbs representing relations between the objects.\nOntologies resemble class hierarchies in object-oriented programming but there are several critical differences. Class hierarchies are meant to represent structures used in source code that evolve fairly slowly (perhaps with monthly revisions) whereas ontologies are meant to represent information on the Internet and are expected to be evolving almost constantly. Similarly, ontologies are typically far more flexible as they are meant to represent information on the Internet coming from all sorts of heterogeneous data sources. Class hierarchies on the other hand tend to be fairly static and rely on far less diverse and more structured sources of data such as corporate databases.\nThe OWL languages are characterized by formal semantics. They are built upon the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) standard for objects called the Resource Description Framework (RDF). OWL and RDF have attracted significant academic, medical and commercial interest.\nIn October 2007, a new W3C working group was started to extend OWL with several new features as proposed in the OWL 1.1 member submission. W3C announced the new version of OWL on 27 October 2009. This new version, called OWL 2, soon found its way into semantic editors such as Protégé and semantic reasoners such as Pellet, RacerPro, FaCT++[10] and HermiT.[11]\nThe OWL family contains many species, serializations, syntaxes and specifications with similar names. OWL and OWL2 are used to refer to the 2004 and 2009 specifications, respectively. Full species names will be used, including specification version (for example, OWL2 EL). When referring more generally, OWL Family will be used.[12][13][14]<>Web Ontology Language (OWL) is a language for representing and reasoning about the semantics of information on the World Wide Web. It is designed to be used with the Resource Description Framework (RDF), which is a standard for representing and exchanging information on the Web. OWL is used to create and describe the relationships between different concepts, or \"terms,\" in a domain.\n\n\n\nOne of the main goals of OWL is to enable machines to process and understand the meaning of the information represented on the Web. This is useful in a variety of applications, such as knowledge management, information retrieval, and natural language processing.\n\n\n\nOWL has a formal syntax and a set of logical rules for defining the meaning of terms and the relationships between them. It includes a rich set of constructs for representing complex relationships and classifications, as well as mechanisms for defining custom classes and properties.\n\n\n\nThere are three levels of expressiveness in OWL: OWL Lite, OWL DL, and OWL Full. OWL Lite is the most basic level, providing a minimal set of constructs for defining class hierarchies and simple relationships between classes. OWL DL is a more expressive level, allowing for the definition of more complex relationships and classifications. OWL Full is the most expressive level, allowing for the definition of arbitrary class and property relationships.<>wiki_csai
