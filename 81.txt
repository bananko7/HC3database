After balloons float so high that we ca n't see them anymore , what happens to them ? I just saw some balloons float really high and they just kept going so I was just curious as to what 's going to happen to them . Please explain like I'm five.<>They go all the way up to the Sun where they burn up . Just kidding . As you go higher , air pressure decreases . But the air pressure inside the balloon stays the same . Since the air inside the balloon is pushing harder than the air outside the balloon , the balloon gets bigger . The higher it goes , the less outside air pressure there is , and the bigger the balloon gets . Eventually it pops :( Same thing happens inside your ears . That 's why they hurt when you go up in a plane . Your ears do n't pop because there is a tube that can open to adjust the pressure . Poor balloon does n't have such a thing . It was just a balloon . It never had a chance .<>As balloons float higher in the sky, the air around them becomes thinner and colder. Eventually, the balloon will become too cold and will pop. When a balloon pops, it breaks into small pieces and falls back down to the ground. Some of the pieces of the balloon may land on the ground, while others may get caught in the wind and blow away. It's also possible that a balloon may not pop, but instead continue to float until it reaches a place where the air is too thin to support it. When this happens, the balloon will fall back down to the ground. However, this can take a very long time and it's not very common for balloons to reach such high altitudes. So, to answer your question, when a balloon floats high enough, it will either pop or fall back down to the ground.<>reddit_eli5
