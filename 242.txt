Why ca n't the washer and dryer be one machine ! ? Why does there need to be two separate spinning barrels ? Please explain like I'm five.<>They can be , and they are extremely common ... URL_0<>A washer and dryer are two separate machines because they perform different functions. A washing machine is designed to clean clothes by using water and detergent to remove dirt and stains. It does this by agitating the clothes in a tub of water and then spinning the tub to remove excess water. \nA dryer, on the other hand, is designed to remove moisture from clothes after they have been washed. It does this by blowing hot air over the clothes as they tumble in a drum. The heat from the air helps to evaporate the moisture from the clothes, and the tumbling action helps to fluff them up and remove wrinkles. \nOne reason that washers and dryers are separate machines is because they require different types of energy to operate. Washing machines typically use electricity to power the agitator and spin the tub, while dryers use electricity or natural gas to generate heat. \nAnother reason is that washing and drying clothes can be time-consuming processes, and having two separate machines allows people to do them at different times or even in different locations. For example, you might wash your clothes at home and then take them to a laundromat to dry them. \nOverall, having separate washers and dryers allows people to more efficiently clean and dry their clothes, and also gives them more flexibility in how they do these tasks.<>reddit_eli5
