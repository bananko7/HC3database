Advice on strategy for when to sell<>You sell when you think the stock is over valued, or you need the money, or you are going to need the money in the next 5 years. I buy and hold a lot.  I bought IBM in 8th grade 1980.  I still own it.  I bought 3 share it from $190 and its now worth $5,000 do to dividend reinvestment and splits.  That stock did nothing for a thirteen years except pay a dividend but then it went up by 1800% the next 20 and paid dividends.  So I agree with other posters the whole pigs get slaughtered thing is silly and just makes fund managers more money. Think if you bought aapl at $8 and sold at $12.  The thing went to 600 and split 7-1 and is back to $120.   My parents made a ton holding Grainger for years and I have had good success with MMM and MSFT owning those for decades.<>There are many factors to consider when deciding when to sell an asset, and there is no one-size-fits-all answer. Here are some things to consider:Market conditions: Is the market currently experiencing a bull or bear trend? If the market is trending downwards, it might be a good time to sell. If the market is trending upwards, it might be a good time to hold onto your asset.Your investment goals: What are you hoping to achieve with your investment? If you have a long-term investment horizon and are trying to build wealth over time, you might be more inclined to hold onto your asset for a longer period of time. On the other hand, if you need to sell in order to meet a specific financial goal, such as paying for a down payment on a house, you may need to sell sooner.Your risk tolerance: How comfortable are you with the potential for price fluctuations? If you are risk-averse and are worried about the possibility of your asset losing value, you might want to sell sooner rather than later. On the other hand, if you are comfortable with a higher level of risk and are willing to ride out market fluctuations, you might be more inclined to hold onto your asset for a longer period of time.Diversification: Is your portfolio diversified, or are you heavily concentrated in a single asset or sector? If you are heavily concentrated in a single asset or sector, it might be a good idea to sell some of your holdings in order to diversify your portfolio.Ultimately, the decision to sell an asset is a personal one and will depend on your individual circumstances and investment goals. It's important to carefully consider all of these factors and consult with a financial advisor or professional if you have any questions or concerns.","Deciding when to sell an investment can be a difficult decision, as it involves anticipating future market conditions and trying to predict when it might be the best time to sell.
