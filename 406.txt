why a word will sound strange or \" not real \" after you say it repeatedly ? Monitor . Monitor . MONitor . moniTOR . monITor . Explain like I'm five.<>This is called * semantic satiation * . According to [ Wikipedia ] ( URL_0 ): > The explanation for the phenomenon was that verbal repetition repeatedly aroused a specific neural pattern in the cortex which corresponds to the meaning of the word . Rapid repetition causes both the peripheral sensorimotor activity and the central neural activation to fire repeatedly , which is known to cause reactive inhibition , hence a reduction in the intensity of the activity with each repetition . I do n't really understand this myself , so I wo n't try to explain it more simply .<>Repeating a word over and over can make it sound strange because our brains are used to hearing words in a certain context and with a certain rhythm. When we hear a word out of its usual context or with a different rhythm, it can feel strange or unfamiliar. This is especially true when we repeat a word that we don't usually say very often. The more we repeat the word, the more unfamiliar it can start to feel. Imagine you are playing a game with a friend and they keep saying the same word over and over. It might start to feel strange or even annoying after a while, right? That's because our brains are used to hearing a variety of words and sounds, and when we hear the same thing repeatedly, it can feel monotonous or boring. So, when you repeat a word like \"monitor\" over and over, it might start to feel strange because your brain isn't used to hearing it so frequently. You might also find that the way you say the word starts to change, as you try to find a new way to say it that feels more natural. This is because our brains are constantly trying to find patterns and make sense of the things we hear, even when we're just repeating a single word.<>reddit_eli5
