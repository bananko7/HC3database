Howcome anxiety and depression are so common ? Is it something to do with society and lifestyles or how children are raised ? Or is it simply because it 's more acceptable to talk about it which means it 's more easily diagnosed ? Explain like I'm five. <>There is not a direct answer to this . I will put some factors : * Impossible to archive standards : I think this is the biggest . Instagram accounts with beautiful people 24\/7 . Those people are posing for the photos and they have all arranged to look perfect . Still it gives us the impression that that 's how they live and \" OH I WANT TO BE LIKE THAT \" . That creates a fear of under - archiving . The \" Fear of missing - out \" . Anxiety . * Massive Social networks . This is the source of anxiety . Everyone is exposed at all times on FB , IG , etc . ( you can choose to do nt join \/ quit , But let 's be honest : Any person from 16 - 23 that does not have a FB account does not exist ... ) This create a need to be accepted in society . \" Oh , I want 1000 likes \" . Major anxiety source . Also bullying * Global economic crisis made everything harder : College , New clothes \/ technologies , families , payments , savings , vacations , getting jobs , travelling ... Leading to frustration and depressions specially in adults . There are a lot of answer for that question . I think I 've talked about some majors<>Anxiety and depression are common for a variety of reasons. It's important to note that everyone is different and may experience different things that contribute to their mental health.\\n\\nOne reason that anxiety and depression may be common is because of the way that people are raised and the environment in which they live. For example, if a child grows up in a household where they are constantly exposed to conflict or are not given the support they need, they may be more prone to anxiety and depression.\\n\\nAnother reason may be due to lifestyle factors, such as not getting enough exercise or not eating a healthy diet. These things can affect a person's physical and mental health.\\n\\nIt's also possible that anxiety and depression are more common now because it is more acceptable to talk about mental health and seek help for it. In the past, people may have been less likely to speak openly about their feelings, so it was harder to diagnose these conditions.\\n\\nRegardless of the cause, it's important to remember that it is possible to get help for anxiety and depression and to work towards feeling better.<>reddit_eli5
