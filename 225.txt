Two people with no knowledge of each others language learning each others languages . How do two people that do n't speak each others languages learn each others languages without having the slightest idea of what the other person is saying . Explain like I'm five.<>So I read a book that had something like this involved . It was about an American family going into their cabin , the son and father go first to make sure everything is ok . Then , the mom , daughter and baby get sick so the father goes bak home to help them , anyway , the boy met a Native American \" tribe \" or \" family \" I do n't quite remember . They would communicate by first doing sign language ( not really but hand signals ) then pick up items and objects and say their names . Basically teaching each other from scratch . That 's how I believe they would TL;DR : using objects , hand gestures and emotions to learn their language . Hope I could help<>Learning a language with someone who speaks a different language can be a bit tricky, but it's definitely possible! Here's one way it could work: First, the two people could try using gestures and drawings to communicate. For example, if one person wants to say \"I'm hungry,\" they could draw a picture of a person with a little line coming out of their stomach. Next, the two people could try using a translation app or website to help them communicate. These tools can translate words and phrases from one language to another. Finally, the two people could try taking language classes together. This way, they can learn the basics of each other's languages and practice speaking and listening to each other. It might take some time and patience, but with practice and effort, the two people can learn to communicate with each other in their different languages.<>reddit_eli5
