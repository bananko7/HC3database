Please explain what is \"Transformational grammar\"<>In linguistics, transformational grammar (TG) or transformational-generative grammar (TGG) is part of the theory of generative grammar, especially of natural languages. It considers grammar to be a system of rules that generate exactly those combinations of words that form grammatical sentences in a given language and involves the use of defined operations (called transformations) to produce new sentences from existing ones. The method is commonly associated with American linguist Noam Chomsky.\nGenerative algebra was first introduced to general linguistics by the structural linguist Louis Hjelmslev although the method was described before him by Albert Sechehaye in 1908. Chomsky adopted the concept of transformations from his teacher Zellig Harris, who followed the American descriptivist separation of semantics from syntax. Hjelmslev's structuralist conception including semantics and pragmatics is incorporated into functional grammar.<>Transformational grammar is a theory of grammar that explains how the structure of a sentence can be generated from a set of rules or principles. It was developed by linguist Noam Chomsky in the 1950s and has had a significant impact on the field of linguistics.\n\n\n\nIn transformational grammar, the basic structure of a sentence is represented by a deep structure, which reflects the underlying meaning of the sentence. This deep structure is then transformed into a surface structure, which is the actual form of the sentence as it is spoken or written. The transformation from deep structure to surface structure is accomplished through a set of rules known as transformational rules.\n\n\n\nTransformational grammar is based on the idea that language is a formal system that is governed by a set of rules and principles, and that these rules and principles can be used to generate an infinite number of sentences. It is an important theoretical framework in linguistics, and has been influential in the development of other theories of grammar, such as generative grammar and minimalist grammar.<>wiki_csai
