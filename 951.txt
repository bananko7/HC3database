Why does AAPL trade at such low multiples?<>This is an opinion, but I think it has more to do with the market's uncertainty about the long-term future of the company without Steve Jobs.  Apple hasn't released anything more than incremental upgrades to its existing product lines since Jobs passed, and while some people would argue about the Apple watch, Jobs played a significant role in its development prior to his death, so that doesn't really count. Whether you like or hate Apple, you had to admire Jobs' passion and creativity, and there's real question as to whether the company can sustain its dominance in the market without the Jobs vision over the long haul.  My guess is that the market is leaning slightly toward the \"no\" column, but only ever so slightly.  The company continues to deliver fantastic results, but how long will that last of their next products don't wow consumers the way previous ones have?  This skepticism manifests itself in a stock that trades at a lower P\/E than it deserves to, but this is just my opinion.   I hope this helps. Good luck!<>It is not accurate to say that Apple Inc. (AAPL) trades at low multiples. In fact, Apple has consistently traded at relatively high price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratios, which are a common measure of a company's valuation. A P\/E ratio is calculated by dividing the current market price of a company's stock by its earnings per share (EPS). A high P\/E ratio can indicate that investors are willing to pay a premium for the company's earnings, while a low P\/E ratio may suggest that the stock is undervalued.There are a number of factors that can influence a company's P\/E ratio, including its financial performance, growth prospects, and risk profile. In the case of Apple, the company has a long track record of strong financial performance, with consistent revenue and earnings growth. It is also a leader in the technology sector, which is known for its high growth potential. These factors may contribute to Apple's relatively high P\/E ratio.It is also important to note that P\/E ratios can vary significantly over time, and can be influenced by market conditions and investor sentiment. As a result, it is important to consider a variety of factors when evaluating a company's valuation, rather than relying on a single metric such as the P\/E ratio.<>finance
