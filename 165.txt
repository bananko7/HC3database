Why did 22lr prices skyrocket and when will we see prices go back to normal ? Edit : 22lr stands for 22 Long Rifle . It 's a bullet caliber . Please explain like I'm five.<>As you no doubt noticed , there was a recent run on .22 ammo ( and other calibers â€” plain ol' 9 mm was hard to come by ) in the wake of Sandy Hook and all the proposed gun control legislation . People wanted to buy it up while they could , which in turn drove the price up . .22 was hit pretty hard , since it 's the single - most ( or one of the most ) popular calibers in both rifles and handguns ( on the consumer market anyway ) . So that massive spike in demand caused a spike in the price . The supplies are coming back to normal , though , as are the prices . We should see \" normal \" prices within a year ( unless there 's another scare ) . I say this based on how a similar scare shook out about 4 years back .<>The price of 22lr (a type of ammunition) has increased in recent years due to a number of factors. One reason is that there has been an increase in demand for firearms and ammunition, especially during times of political uncertainty or social unrest. This can lead to shortages of certain types of ammunition, including 22lr, which can cause the price to go up. Additionally, the cost of raw materials, labor, and transportation can also affect the price of 22lr. It is difficult to predict when the price of 22lr will return to normal levels, as it depends on a number of economic and market factors. However, prices may eventually stabilize as the demand for firearms and ammunition decreases or as more suppliers enter the market.<>reddit_eli5
