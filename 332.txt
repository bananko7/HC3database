Why do young children have such a low pain tolerance ? Title Explain like I'm five.<>I would n't say that is the case . After young kids get hurt , they look to adults for how they should react . Often in America , parents rush over and make a big deal out of it , and kids think that is the reaction they should have . In South America , I once saw a kid come back home from playing soccer with a broken arm . Which he broke 2 hours ago , but he just wanted to keep playing .<>Young children have a lower pain tolerance than adults because their brains are still developing. When we feel pain, our brains process it and send signals to the rest of our body to let us know that something is wrong. In adults, this process is more developed and sophisticated, so we are better able to handle and manage pain. In children, however, the parts of the brain that deal with pain are still growing and learning, which means that they may feel pain more intensely and have a harder time coping with it.<>reddit_eli5
