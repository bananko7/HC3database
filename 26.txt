Why is 2 % volume not twice as loud as 1 % volume ? I would just like to know , for this has baffled me ever since I 've had a computer . Explain like I'm five.<>The percentages associated with volume levels on your computer have no physical meaning . They are constructed by engineers to create a reasonable distribution of volume as it is perceived by your ears . That 's why two devices will have a different noise level for \" 60 % volume \" even if their max volumes are the same .<>The volume of a sound is measured in decibels (dB). When we say that a sound is twice as loud as another sound, we mean that the first sound has twice the intensity of the second sound. Intensity is a measure of the amount of energy that a sound wave carries.\r\n\r\nWhen we increase the volume of a sound on a computer or other device, we are increasing the intensity of the sound wave. However, the way that volume is typically measured and controlled on a device doesn't always increase the intensity of the sound wave in a linear way.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you increase the volume of a sound from 1% to 2%, the intensity of the sound wave may not double. This is because the volume control on a device often uses a logarithmic scale, rather than a linear scale. This means that each increase in volume by a certain percentage represents a much smaller increase in intensity than the previous increase.\r\n\r\nSo, even though you may think that increasing the volume from 1% to 2% should make the sound twice as loud, it may not seem that way because the intensity of the sound wave is not actually doubling.<>The volume of a sound is measured in decibels (dB).
