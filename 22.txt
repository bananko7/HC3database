What does the term \" meta \" mean ? Seen it everywhere on Reddit , but I do n't know what it means . Can anyone explain please ? Explain like I'm five.<>For example , Metadata is data about data . It 's an abstraction of itself . The reason reddit feels like it 's meta is because reddit so often references itself .<>\"Meta\" is a term that is used to describe something that is about itself or about other things in its category. It can be used to describe a wide range of things, including discussions, comments, or observations that are about the topic or context in which they are being made.\n\nFor example, if someone is having a discussion about a particular subreddit (a section of the website Reddit), they might make a \"meta\" comment about the subreddit itself, rather than the topic that is being discussed within the subreddit. In this case, the word \"meta\" is being used to describe a comment that is about the subreddit rather than the topic at hand.\n\nAnother way that the term \"meta\" is used is to describe something that is self-referential or self-aware. For example, a movie or book might be described as \"meta\" if it is about itself or about the process of creating art.\n\nOverall, the term \"meta\" is a way to describe something that is about itself or about the context in which it is being discussed. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.<>\"Meta\" is a term that is used to describe something that is about itself or about other things in its category.
