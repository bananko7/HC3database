Please explain like I'm five.<>It is for comfortability . Many people feel uncomfortable with members of the opposite sex around while they are doing their business . It is that simple .<>Men's and women's restrooms are separate because they are designed to accommodate the specific biological needs of each gender. For example, men's restrooms typically have urinals, while women's restrooms typically have stalls with toilets. \nSeparate restrooms can be seen as a way to ensure that everyone has access to the facilities they need in a way that is convenient and private. Some people may feel more comfortable using a restroom that is designated for their gender, particularly if they are transgender or non-binary and may not feel safe using a restroom that does not align with their gender identity. \nIt is possible that society could reach a point where separate restrooms are no longer necessary or desired. Some people believe that gender-neutral restrooms, which are open to people of all genders, could be a more inclusive solution.
