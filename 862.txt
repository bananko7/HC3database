Why can I hear the sound of the record playing on my turntable when my speakers\/ receiver are n't on ? There 's no speaker on my turntable but I can still hear the sound of the music playing coming from around the needle . Please explain like I'm five.<>The grooves in the record vibrating the needle is where the actual sound comes from . It 's a physical form of music , not digital . All the cords and such just amplify the sound and carry it to speakers .<>When you play a record on a turntable, the needle (also called a stylus) follows the grooves on the record and vibrates according to the music recorded on the record. These vibrations are converted into electrical signals by the turntable's cartridge. The electrical signals are then sent to your speakers or receiver, which amplify the signals and turn them back into sound waves that you can hear. However, even if your speakers or receiver are not turned on, you can still hear the sound of the music being played on the turntable because the needle is vibrating and creating sound waves directly. These sound waves travel through the air and can be heard by your ears, even if they are not being amplified by speakers or a receiver. So, in this case, the sound of the music is coming from the needle on the turntable and not from the speakers or receiver.<>reddit_eli5
