why bio - hazard suits are so puffy . It just seems they would be more likely to snag which is definitely not what you want in that situation . Please explain like I'm five.<>Because the suits have air being constantly blown in so that the scientists inside the can breathe . Also , constantly blowing air in has the benefit that if the suit gets a puncture , the air gushing out of the suit will prevent air ( and germs ) from spilling INTO the suit .<>Biohazard suits are designed to protect the wearer from potentially harmful substances, such as bacteria, viruses, and chemicals. These suits are made to be as protective as possible, so they are often made of materials that can withstand exposure to hazardous substances. One reason why biohazard suits are puffy is because they are often made with layers of material to provide extra protection. For example, the suit might have an outer layer made of a durable material like plastic or rubber, and an inner layer made of a material that can absorb moisture, like cotton or polyester. The layers of material help to keep the hazardous substances from coming into contact with the person wearing the suit. Another reason why biohazard suits are puffy is because they often have airtight seals around the wrists, ankles, and neck to prevent any hazardous substances from getting inside the suit. The seals are designed to be tight-fitting, so they need to have some extra space to allow the person wearing the suit to move around comfortably. Overall, the puffy appearance of biohazard suits is necessary to provide the maximum amount of protection to the person wearing the suit. While it may seem like the suit could be more prone to snagging, the materials used to make the suit are typically very strong and resistant to tearing.<>reddit_eli5
