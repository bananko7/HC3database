Why did older video games use checkpoints or locations to have to save your game instead of an options menu button like is most common now ? more like why technically , was it limited by the systems or etc ... Explain like I'm five. <>I did some reading on this and it seems that the method of saving really depends on the developer , and less about technology . Not to say there were technological constraints , of course . Games use to be cartridge based , so saves had to be as predetermined points because all of the information was on the cartridge itself , done with either direct savepoints and sometimes with passwords . When games converted to disc , the save information was stored on memory cards in earlier consoles because CD - ROMs are Read Only Memory and can not personally store the save . But now all console saves are done on hard drives , and some games like * Destiny * and * Tom Clancy 's The Division * require to be always connected to the internet and use the cloud to store information . But it really depends on the developer , but almost all games have gone the way of autosaving so the player is n't too far behind after dying .<>In the past, video game consoles and computers did not have as much memory as they do now, so they couldn't store your progress in a game as easily. Because of this, video game developers had to come up with a way for players to save their progress in a game. One way they did this was by using checkpoints or special locations where the game would automatically save your progress. This way, if you turned off the game or the console, you could start from the last checkpoint you reached instead of having to start the whole game over again. Nowadays, most video game consoles and computers have much more memory, so developers can allow players to save their progress anytime they want using an options menu button.<>reddit_eli5
