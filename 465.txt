When we scream, we are sending a message to others that we need help or are in distress.\n\nScreaming can also be a way to release tension or fear that we may be feeling when we are in pain. It can help us cope with the pain or fear by letting it out in a loud and vocal way.\n\nAnimals also use vocalizations as a way to communicate distress or pain. For example, a dog may whine or yelp if it is hurt, and a cat may meow loudly if it is in pain. This helps other animals or humans nearby understand that something is wrong and that the animal needs help.\n\nOverall, screaming is a natural and instinctive way for both humans and animals to communicate pain or distress and to seek help in times of need.<>reddit_eli5
