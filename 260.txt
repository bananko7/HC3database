Is there a general guideline for what percentage of a portfolio should be in gold?<>The \"conventional wisdom\" is that you should have about 5% of your portfolio in gold. But that's an AVERAGE. Meaning that you might want to have 10% at some times (like now) and 0% in the 1980s. Right now, the price of gold has been rising, because of fears of \"easing\" Fed monetary policy (for the past decade), culminating in recent \"quantitative easing.\" In the 1980s, you should have had 0% in gold given the fall of gold in 1981 because of Paul Volcker's monetary tightening policies, and other reasons. Why did gold prices drop in 1981? And a word of caution: If you don't understand the impact of \"quantitative easing\" or \"Paul Volcker\" on gold prices, you probably shouldn't be buying it.<>There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the appropriate allocation of gold in an investment portfolio depends on an individual's financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment time horizon. Some investors choose to include gold in their portfolio as a hedge against inflation or economic uncertainty, while others view it as a speculative investment.As with any investment, it is important to diversify your portfolio and not to allocate too much of your assets into any one particular investment. In general, financial advisors recommend that investors keep a relatively small portion of their portfolio (e.g., 5-10%) in gold or other alternative assets such as real estate or collectibles. However, this can vary depending on your individual circumstances and financial goals.It is also important to keep in mind that investing in gold carries its own set of risks. The price of gold can be volatile and may fluctuate significantly over time. In addition, investing in physical gold (e.g., gold coins or bars) also carries storage and insurance risks.Ultimately, it is important to consider your personal financial situation and risk tolerance when deciding how much, if any, gold to include in your investment portfolio. It may be helpful to consult with a financial advisor or professional to determine the appropriate allocation of gold in your portfolio.<>finance
