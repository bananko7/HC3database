Please explain what is \"Missile guidance\"<>Missile guidance refers to a variety of methods of guiding a missile or a guided bomb to its intended target. The missile's target accuracy is a critical factor for its effectiveness. Guidance systems improve missile accuracy by improving its Probability of Guidance (Pg).\nThese guidance technologies can generally be divided up into a number of categories, with the broadest categories being \"active\", \"passive\", and \"preset\" guidance. Missiles and guided bombs generally use similar types of guidance system, the difference between the two being that missiles are powered by an onboard engine, whereas guided bombs rely on the speed and height of the launch aircraft for propulsion.<>Missile guidance refers to the techniques and systems used to control the flight path of a missile or other projectile so that it can accurately hit a target. This involves both guidance systems that provide direction and control signals to the missile during its flight, as well as sensors and other devices that allow the missile to detect and track the target.\n\n\n\nThere are several different types of missile guidance systems, including:\n\n\n\nInertial guidance: This involves using a set of sensors and a computer to calculate the missile's position, velocity, and acceleration. The computer then uses this information to calculate the necessary guidance commands to steer the missile towards the target.\n\n\n\nActive guidance: This involves using a radar or other active sensing system to detect the target and provide guidance signals to the missile.\n\n\n\nPassive guidance: This involves using the missile's own sensors to detect the target and guide itself towards it.\n\n\n\nSemi-active guidance: This involves using a radar or other active sensing system to detect the target and provide guidance signals to the missile, but the missile also has its own sensors to help it track the target.\n\n\n\nOverall, the goal of missile guidance is to provide a high degree of accuracy and precision in order to effectively hit the intended target.<>wiki_csai
