How come the lobe of the brain controlling vision is in the back ? I am studying brain anatomy right now in anatomy and cases like this keep popping up . Is there a simple explanation ? Explain like I'm five. <>It just is . It 's not a satisfying answer , but it 's the right one . It might seem logical that the visual cortex would be as close to the eyes as possible , but if there was an evolutionary disadvantage to having the visual cortex at the back of the brain instead of near the eyes , it would n't be that way . The fact that the visual cortex is where it is shows that there 's no disadvantage to having it in the back of the brain . In addition , it is not the case that fibers are not \" just \" running from the eyes all the way back to the visual cortex - there are additional targets for the signals from the retina besides the visual cortex . And even for signals that end up a the visual cortex , there is quite a bit of processing that happens along they way in other parts of the brain before reaching the visual cortex .<>The lobe of the brain that controls vision is called the occipital lobe and it is located at the back of the brain. There are several reasons why the occipital lobe is located in the back of the brain.\\n\\nOne reason is that the occipital lobe is responsible for processing visual information that comes in through the eyes. The eyes are located on the front of the head, so the visual information has to travel to the back of the brain to be processed.\\n\\nAnother reason is that the occipital lobe is located near the brain stem, which controls important functions such as breathing and heart rate. By being located near the brain stem, the occipital lobe has a direct connection to these important functions and can help regulate them.\\n\\nFinally, the occipital lobe is located near the cerebellum, which is responsible for coordinating movement and balance. The occipital lobe and the cerebellum work together to help us move and react to what we see.\\n\\nOverall, the occipital lobe is located in the back of the brain because it is responsible for processing visual information and it needs to be close to other important parts of the brain that help us move and stay healthy.<>reddit_eli5
