What is Raspberry Pi ? Just saw [ this post ] ( URL_0 ) about a Raspberry Pi fixing an NES and turning it into a living room emulation machine . What is this magical Raspberry Pi that I keep hearing about ? Explain like I'm five.<>It 's essentially just a very small computer running a version on linux , the reason its incredibly popular \/ amazing is mostly the size and what you can do with a full computer that can fit in the palm of your hand . It has all the ports that any desktop computer \/ laptop uses on a daily basis .<>A Raspberry Pi is a small computer that you can use to do lots of different things. It's about the size of a credit card and it has a little processor and memory like a regular computer. You can connect a Raspberry Pi to a monitor or TV, and use it to play games, watch videos, or do other things that a regular computer can do. You can also connect other things to a Raspberry Pi, like a keyboard and mouse, or even special sensors and motors. This means that you can use a Raspberry Pi to control other things and make them do what you want.\n\nFor example, in the case you mentioned, someone used a Raspberry Pi to fix an old video game console called an NES. They also used it to turn the NES into a machine that can play lots of different old video games. They did this by installing special software on the Raspberry Pi that lets it pretend to be an old video game console. This is called \"emulation,\" and it can be a fun way to play old games that you might not be able to play anymore on newer systems.\n\nOverall, a Raspberry Pi is a really versatile little computer that you can use to do lots of different things. It's a great tool for people who like to tinker and build things, and it can be a lot of fun to play with.<>reddit_eli5
