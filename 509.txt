how come undercover police operations ( particularly those where police pretend to be sex workers ) do n't count as entrapment ? I guess the title is fairly self - explanatory ? Explain like I'm five.<>I believe that for entrapment there has to be a scenario in which the person who committed the crime would not have done so without the police intervention ( e.g. a cop pressuring someone into buying drugs , and then busting them ) . With an undercover operation , the criminal organization \/ operation would happen * regardless * of the police presence . They are n't being * entrapped * or somehow tricked into performing the criminal act - they are going to do it anyways . Edit : \/u \/ avfc41 posted a link [ here ] ( URL_0 ) that is absolutely brilliant , and the [ author ] ( URL_2 ) of the comic in question responded . Great visual aid to understand the concept more thoroughly . Edit Edit : A few people have commented on various scenarios , but when it comes down to it , its only going to be entrapment if the Officer(s ) involved create a situation in which the person * has no choice but to commit the act * , with degrees of variance depending on context . \/u \/ CornellBigRed posted [ here ] ( URL_3 ) that [ this court case ] ( URL_1 ) , which shows that there is a line that is drawn - but it will likely be drawn in court where more evidence can be presented Chances are that if you are arrested and want to bring up entrapment , its going to be very situation specific , taking into account a lot of context and investigation to figure out if the police \/ agents involved in the arrest provided too much pressure , to the point where the intent was more strongly influenced by the government , rather than the accused 's actual predisposition to commit the crime . Edit Edit Edit : Lots of scenarios - guys , look , when it comes down to it , if you are arrested by an undercover cop , its going be centered around how you defend yourself in trial . You have to prove that you simply would not have done it if it were not for the pressure on you , and it has to be believable . You have to convince the judge , or the jury , or both , that you were coerced . Whatever scenario , tip , trick that you have , when it comes down to it , if you 're arrested , then its all up to how you defend yourself and how much proof you can bring to the table . I do not believe you saying that you were coerced is going to be enough - you want enough proof to make it such that the prosecution can not mount a good argument for why you did it willingly . A good defense attorney is going to be important in cases like this .<>Undercover police operations, including those where police pretend to be sex workers, are not considered entrapment because they are not coercing or forcing anyone to commit a crime. Entrapment occurs when law enforcement officers or agents induce a person to commit a crime that they were not previously disposed to commit. In other words, entrapment is when the police trick or lure someone into committing a crime that they otherwise would not have committed.\r\n\r\nIn the case of undercover police operations, the police are not trying to trick or lure anyone into committing a crime. Instead, they are posing as potential customers or clients in order to gather evidence and build a case against individuals who are already engaged in criminal activity. The individuals who choose to commit a crime in these situations are doing so of their own free will, not because they have been coerced or entrapped by the police.\r\n\r\nI hope that helps to clarify things! Let me know if you have any other questions.<>reddit_eli5
