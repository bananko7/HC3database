The way a lithium battery works is that during operation Lithium ions are removed from a lithium bearing compound from one contact , transferred across an electrolyte , and deposited on the other contact . When recharging , the process is reversed . The degradation comes from the fact that each time the cycle is performed , impurities are introduced into the structure of contacts , reducing their effectiveness .<>Laptop batteries have a limited number of charge cycles, which means that they can only be charged and discharged a certain number of times before they begin to lose capacity. When a battery is charged and then discharged, it is considered to have gone through one charge cycle. As a battery goes through more charge cycles, it will eventually lose some of its capacity to hold a charge and will not last as long before needing to be recharged.\n\nThere are a few things you can do to help extend the life of your laptop battery:\n\nKeep your laptop cool: Excessive heat can damage the battery and reduce its overall life.\n\nAvoid fully discharging the battery: It's best to keep your battery charged between 40% and 80% when possible.\n\nUse battery-saving features: Many laptops have power-saving features that can help extend the life of the battery.\n\nDon't leave your laptop plugged in all the time: It's fine to leave your laptop plugged in when you're using it, but it's best to unplug it when it's not in use to help extend the battery's overall life.\n\nAvoid using the laptop on battery power for long periods of time: If you'll be using your laptop for an extended period of time, it's best to keep it plugged in to help extend the life of the battery.\n\nBy following these tips, you can help extend the life of your laptop battery and get the most out of it.<>reddit_eli5
