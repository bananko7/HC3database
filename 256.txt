Why we have different blood types Why do humans have different blood types ? Do animals have different blood types ? Explain like I'm five.<>ELI5 - year - old that knows the basics of blood types and evolution : * * Humans have different blood types because the human species evolved that way . * * It 's good for the species as a whole to have people be different , that way at least some people can survive deadly diseases . Deadly diseases , often viruses , come along from time to time . Because everyone is different , at least a few people will likely be resistant to it . A person 's blood type ( i.e. , the antigens they have in their blood ) is often relevant to whether they 're resistant to a disease . A deadly disease is certainly a bad thing . But as long as there are survivors , the entire human population wo n't be wiped out . In case you did n't know , there actually are dozens of blood type combinations . A \/ B \/ O and + \/- are just two of 30 different ways a person 's blood can be unique . Some of these differences can benefit the person who has them . For example , there is something call the Duffy antigen . Some people have it in their blood , others do n't . People who do n't have the Duffy antigen are resistant to malaria , a deadly disease common in tropical climates . Other differences do n't have a big obvious benefit . For example , scientists currently do n't fully understand how the A \/ B antigens work ( it 's complex ! ) However even without a big obvious benefit , it 's safer for species to have these blood type differences . Viruses and other diseases come and go , and you never know if a specific antigen type will be relevant . * * Yes , animals certainly do have different blood types . * * Depending on the species , some of the antigen types are similar or identical to humans . ---- More reading ( not for five - year - olds ): * [ r \/ askscience : Why did we evolve with different blood types ? ] ( URL_2 ) * [ Scientific American : Why do people have different blood types ? ] ( URL_0 ) * [ Wikipedia : Blood type ] ( URL_1 ) * [ Wikipedia : Blood type ( non - human ) ] ( URL_1 _ ( non - human%29 )<>Sure! Blood is a special type of fluid that helps our body work properly. It carries oxygen and other important things to all the parts of our body. Blood also helps our body fight off infections and diseases.\n\nThere are different types of blood because our bodies have special proteins called antigens on the surface of our red blood cells. These antigens can be either \"A,\" \"B,\" \"AB,\" or \"O.\" They help our bodies recognize which cells are our own and which ones are not.\n\nSome people have \"A\" antigens on their red blood cells, some have \"B,\" some have \"AB,\" and some have \"O.\" This is why we have different blood types.\n\nNot all animals have different blood types like humans do. Some animals, like dogs, have different blood types, but others, like cats, do not.<>reddit_eli5
