College student lacking investment experience: How to begin investing money? <>If you have wage income that is reported on a W2 form, you can contribute the maximum of your wages, what you can afford, or $5500 in a Roth IRA.   One advantage of this is that the nominal amounts you contribute can always be removed without tax consequences, so a Roth IRA can be a deep emergency fund (i.e., if the choice is $2000 in cash as emergency fund or $2000 in cash in a 2015 Roth IRA contribution, choice 2 gives you more flexibility and optimistic upside at the risk of not being able to draw on interest\/gains until you retire or claim losses on your tax return).  If you let April 15 2016 pass by without making a Roth IRA contribution, you lose the 2015 limit forever.  If you are presently a student and partially employed, you are most likely in the lowest marginal tax rate you will be in for decades, which utilizes the Roth tax game effectively.   If you're estimating \"a few hundred\", then what you pick as an investment is going to be less important than making the contributions.  That is, you can pick any mutual fund that strikes your fancy and be prepared to gain or lose, call it $50\/year (or pick a single stock and be prepared to lose it all).  At some point, you need to understand your emotions around volatility, and the only tuition for this school is taking a loss and having the presence of mind to examine any panic responses you may have.  No reason not to learn this on \"a few hundred\".  While it's not ideal to have losses in a Roth, \"a few hundred\" is not consequential in the long run.   If you're not prepared at this time in your life for the possibility of losing it all (or will need the money within a year or few, as your edit suggests), keep it in cash and try to reduce your expenses to contribute more.  Can you contribute another $100?  You will have more money at the end of the year than investment choice will likely return.<>Starting to invest can be a great way to grow your money over time and achieve your financial goals. Here are a few steps you can take to get started:Determine your investment goals: What are you hoping to achieve through investing? Do you want to save for retirement, or are you looking to generate income or grow your wealth in the short term? Having clear goals will help you decide how to allocate your investments.Assess your risk tolerance: Different types of investments come with different levels of risk. It's important to be comfortable with the level of risk you are taking on, as this can help you stay invested even during market ups and downs.Develop a diversified portfolio: Diversification is a key principle of investing that can help manage risk by spreading your investments across a variety of asset classes. This can include stocks, bonds, and cash, as well as investments in different sectors and geographic regions.Consider your investment timeline: How long do you have until you need to use the money you are investing? If you have a longer time horizon, you may be able to take on more risk, as you have more time to ride out any short-term market volatility.Choose an investment account: There are several types of investment accounts to choose from, including individual brokerage accounts, employer-sponsored 401(k) plans, and IRA accounts. Consider factors such as fees, investment options, and tax implications when deciding which account is right for you.Educate yourself: Investing can be complex, and it's important to do your due diligence before making any investment decisions.
