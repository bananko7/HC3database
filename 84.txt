Why are Anarchists usually considered lunatics or teenagers ? There used to be alot more anarchists , some are even responsible for big things like labor laws . How come they are n't a more prominent party ? Explain like I'm five.<>Too radical for current and perhaps all times . Radical in the basic sense : anarchists question social structure in its most fundamental form . Anarchists did create shifts in political landscape , but their ideals of society without state and totally decentralized political power require a society able to take that kind of responsibility . And there are strong arguments that would claim a centralized power is necessary for protection of people incapable of exercising political power . Teens and youth are espoused with anarchism due to the perception that youth are more likely to accept an ideal of individuals ' ability and responsibility levels . They have n't yet met enough morons to realize otherwise .<>Anarchists are a group of people who believe in the idea of having no government or rulers. Some people may view them as lunatics or teenagers because they believe in a radical idea that goes against the traditional way of organizing society. However, it is important to note that not all anarchists are the same, and there are many different interpretations of anarchism. There used to be more anarchists in the past, and some anarchists have made important contributions to society, such as fighting for labor rights. However, anarchism is not a very popular or well-known political ideology, and there are not many political parties or groups that identify as anarchist. This is probably because anarchism is seen as a radical and extreme ideology, and many people may not agree with the idea of having no government or rulers. Additionally, anarchism does not have a clear set of policies or strategies for achieving its goals, which makes it difficult for anarchism to gain widespread support or become a more prominent political force.<>reddit_eli5
