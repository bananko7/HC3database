Quantum Mechanics vs. General Relativity ! ? i m confused ... how to they not work toghter ... Please explain like I'm five.<>This is gon na be a long one , so just bear with me . Our current understanding of quantum physics operates is called \" quantum field theory . \" The idea is that there are \" fields \" that permeate all of space , and particles are \" excitations \" in those fields . For an analogy , imagine a very still pond . If you put some energy into the pond , maybe by smacking the surface , you 'll create a ripple in the pond . If you switch the word \" pond \" with \" electron field \" and \" ripple \" with \" electron , \" you have a very basic understanding of quantum field theory . It 's the study of how those \" ripples \" interact with each other . So , for example , if you have two electrons , they will repel each other because of their charge . The way that 's understood is that the electron field is \" coupled \" to a second field , the \" electromagnetic \" or \" photon \" field ( I hate both names , personally ) . Take your pond , and imagine that it 's sitting on top of a layer of some other fluid , like oil . The fluids do n't mix , but a ripple in one can cause a ripple in the other . So , the idea is that if there 's two electrons on the pond , the ripple from electron A will make a ripple in the oil , which goes over to electron B and causes it to be deflected . The \" electron ripples \" did n't interact * directly * , they interacted via the oil which they 're coupled to . An oil ripple \" mediated the interaction , \" it 's how the electrons managed to exert forces on each other . That all seems well and good , but there 's a problem . Even in our pond analogy , it seems silly to assume that a ripple in the oil would n't affect the water it 's traveling under as it goes over to the other \" electron . \" After all , if electrons can cause ripples in oil , should n't ripples in oil be able to make electrons ? Well , yeah , they can and they do . To use physics terms , a \" ripple in oil \" is actually a so - called \" virtual photon . \" It 's not actually a photon , but it acts sort of like one . And , like a real photon , it can spontaneously turn into an electron , which is just like how an oil ripple could cause a water ripple . It actually makes an electron \/ positron pair ( the positron is the antiparticle of the electron ) , which will be important later . So , when we do math , we have to take into a count the fact that this can happen . More specifically , it 's called a \" loop correction , \" though you do n't really need to know why . What happens when we factor in our loop corrections , though , is that we end up with divergences , which are numbers that blow up to infinity . That ca n't be correct , so is field theory wrong ? Well , no . What some clever people realized is that the parameters we were plugging into our equations -- the mass \/ charge of the electron , for example -- were determined by experiment . If QFT is true , though , then the values we obtained experimentally should have the loop corrections * already factored in . * So , there are some \" bare \" quantities which are physical parameters that are true * before * you apply loop corrections , and then there are * renormalizing * quantities that have to be accounted for when you apply loop corrections . Subtracting the bare ( infinite ) quantities from the renormalizing ( also infinite ) quantities gives you the real experimentally verified values , which are finite . Lots of people have objections to this technique , and their objections may very well be sound , but let 's not go into that . Suffice to say that saying \" infinity minus infinity = something finite \" is really hand - wavey , and should give most mathematicians headaches . Now , gravity . Let 's suppose that it works like electromagnetism . Particles with mass ( we might as well just stick with electrons ) are ripples in a pond , and they sit on top another type of \" oil pond \" called the \" gravity pond , \" just like how it sat on the \" photon pond . \" The problem is that the loop corrections for gravity wo n't be renormalizable . Suppose my \" gravity ripple , \" which is called a \" graviton , \" is just like the photon , and it can make electrons as well . It should , after all , for the same reasons that the photon could . The problem is that what happens as the graviton travels from electron A to electron B is that it just makes more electrons . Those electrons should be attracted to each other , which strengthens gravity even more . Then , those electrons make * more * electrons through their interaction with the original pair , and the attraction gets even stronger , and then those electrons make * more * ... and so on . With electromagnetism , this was n't as much of an issue . Remember how I said what actually happens is that an electron \/ positron * pair * is produced ? Well , positrons are positively charged , so having the positron there cancels out the additional repulsion that the extra electron would 've made . Renormalization was still an issue , but for different reasons . Here , though , we ca n't write off that extra interaction strength because of the new masses . There 's no \" negative mass \" to counteract that extra attraction , there 's just more and more mass . So , the loop corrections to quantum gravity are divergent ( blow up to infinity ) , but not in a way that we can renormalize away . What happens is that as we try to add renormalization parameters , we start just needing to add more and more and more of them : an infinite number , in fact . Hence , gravity is not renormalizable , because we ca n't keep just tacking on parameters in a meaningful way just to force the theory to work out the way we want . edit : By the way , I should mention that quantum gravity does work on sufficiently large scales . It 's somewhat counter - intuitive , but the greater the interaction distance , the * less * loop corrections matter . They can be effectively ignored at certain scales , as can the loop corrections for electromagnetism .<>Sure! Let me see if I can explain this in a way that is easy to understand. Quantum mechanics is a theory that helps us understand how very small things, like atoms and particles, behave. It is very good at explaining the strange and weird things that happen at the tiny scales of atoms and particles. General relativity is a theory that helps us understand how gravity works. It explains how things like planets and galaxies move and behave, and it is very good at explaining the way that large things move and behave. Now, the strange thing is that these two theories don't always work well together. For example, when we try to use both theories to understand what is happening inside a black hole, they give us very different answers. This is one of the biggest mysteries in physics, and scientists are still trying to figure out how to make these two theories work together. Does that make sense?<>reddit_eli5
