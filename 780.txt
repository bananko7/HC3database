Why do cars only have defroster grids in the rear window ? I am thinking it has something to do with what might happen if the windshield shattered , but it would be convenient a lot of the time . Please explain like I'm five.<>Rear window is far enough back that the lines of the defroster grid are not too distracting during the brief glances back drivers make during driving . Putting those lines in the front window would prove to be hazardous to many drivers by being visual distractions . This is the same reason LEO 's will issue tickets for driving with large cracks in your front windows , and that hanging stuff from your rear - view mirror is ticketable as well ( usually only happens if you 've ticked off the officer ) .<>Cars only have defroster grids in the rear window because the front windshield is made of different material than the rear window. The front windshield is made of laminated safety glass, which is two layers of glass with a plastic layer in between. The laminated safety glass is designed to stay in one piece even if it cracks or breaks, so it doesn't need a defroster grid to help clear it. \nThe rear window, on the other hand, is usually made of tempered glass, which is a type of glass that shatters into small pieces if it breaks. Tempered glass is used in the rear window because it is stronger and more durable than regular glass, but it is also more prone to fogging up or getting covered in condensation. That's why the rear window has a defroster grid, which is a grid of heating elements that help clear the window of fog or condensation. \nSo, in short, cars have defroster grids in the rear window because it is made of a different type of glass that is more prone to fogging up, and because the front windshield is made of laminated safety glass that doesn't need a defroster grid.<>reddit_eli5
