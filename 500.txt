Why is plant protein less bioavalible than animal protein ? People keep saying that animal protein is more \" bioavalible , \" but is n't an amino acid an amino acid ? Explain like I'm five. <>Plant cells contain more soluble fiber , which has been shown to reduce how much protein and other macromolecules we can digest for reasons not completely understood .<>Protein is made up of small molecules called amino acids. The human body needs a certain amount of each of these amino acids to function properly. Animal proteins generally contain all of the amino acids that the human body needs in the right amounts, while plant proteins may be missing one or more of the essential amino acids. This is why plant protein is considered less \"bioavailable\" than animal protein.\\n\\nTo make up for this, it is important for people who follow a plant-based diet to eat a variety of protein sources and to combine different plant proteins (such as beans and rice, or peanuts and whole wheat bread) to get all of the essential amino acids that the body needs.\\n\\nIt's also worth noting that the bioavailability of protein from different sources can vary based on a number of factors, such as the presence of other nutrients (such as fiber) that can affect how well the body absorbs the protein. Additionally, some people may have difficulty digesting certain types of protein, which can affect how well their body is able to use the protein.<>reddit_eli5
