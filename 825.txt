How did we become to trust banks with all our money ? I know if I were in the early years of banking I sure as hell would n't trust them with my life savings . Explain like I'm five.<>The original conception of a bank was simply a storehouse for wealth , initially represented by money . Rather than keep all your wealth on you ( robbery ) or at your home ( theft , home invasion robbery ) , you pay for your wealth to be securely guarded by people who 's jobs it is to protect that money . True banking came about when bankers started loaning that money out as loans with interest rates . This was seen as a good idea by depositors , as they would no longer have to pay a fee for their wealth to be guarded . Additionally , banks could now accept more deposits and accounts from more people since every deposit represents float they can use to issue loans ( rather than a cost ) . Bank runs and closures were always an issue of course but far less prevalent than simple robbery .<>\\nBanks have been around for a long time, and people have trusted them with their money for many years because banks are very good at keeping money safe. When you give your money to a bank, they keep it in a special place called a \"vault\" that is very secure and hard for anyone to break into. Banks also have rules and regulations that they have to follow to make sure they are using your money in a responsible way.\\n\\nIn addition to keeping your money safe, banks can also help you save your money and make it grow. They do this by giving you interest on your money, which means they will pay you a little bit of extra money just for keeping your money in their bank. This can help your money grow over time, so you can use it to buy things you want or need in the future.\\n\\nFinally, banks are very trustworthy because they are regulated by the government, which means they have to follow strict rules to make sure they are doing everything correctly. This helps ensure that your money is safe and that the bank is acting in a responsible way.\\n\\nSo, even though it may seem scary to trust a bank with your money, they are actually very good at keeping it safe and helping it grow, which is why many people choose to use banks to manage their money.<>reddit_eli5
