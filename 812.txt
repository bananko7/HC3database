If the universe is constantly expanding at all points , how can earth ( and other planets ) maintain a cyclic orbit around the Sun ? Would n't the distance between the sun and planets slowly increase which would cause them to eventually lose orbit ? Please explain like I'm five.<>The other answer is wrong . The distance between the earth and the sun is not increasing due to the expansion of space . The gravitational well that is created by our galaxy forbids it . In other words , the gravitational force generated by our entire galaxy counteracts the effects of the expanding universe , and * within * the galaxy ( where we live ) , space is not expanding .<>The universe is indeed expanding, but this expansion is happening on a very large scale. On the scale of our solar system, the distances between the sun and the planets are not increasing significantly due to the expansion of the universe. The reason the planets are able to maintain their orbits around the sun is due to the force of gravity. Gravity is a force that attracts two objects with mass towards each other. The sun has a very large mass, and so it exerts a strong gravitational force on the planets, pulling them towards it. The planets are constantly being pulled towards the sun, but because they are moving in a circular orbit, they never actually reach the sun. Instead, they keep \"falling\" towards the sun but miss it due to their sideways motion, which keeps them in orbit. So, to summarize, the expansion of the universe is happening on a much larger scale than the solar system, and therefore it does not significantly affect the orbits of the planets around the sun. The planets are able to maintain their orbits because of the force of gravity pulling them towards the sun.<>reddit_eli5
