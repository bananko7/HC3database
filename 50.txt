What would happen if I popped outside on Mars in shorts and t - shirt ? Lets let I need a wee and popped outside ( holding my breath due to the lack of oxygen ) . What would happen ? Please explain like I'm five.<>You would die . Also , you would n't be able to hold your breath . The pressure differential is too great . You would quickly asphyxiate , then freeze .<>If you were to go outside on Mars wearing just a t-shirt and shorts, you would not be able to survive for very long. The temperature on Mars can be very cold, and you would quickly become very cold and potentially suffer from hypothermia. Additionally, Mars does not have an atmosphere that can sustain human life. There is no oxygen on Mars, so you would not be able to breathe. If you tried to hold your breath, you would eventually run out of oxygen in your body and would lose consciousness. It is not safe to go outside on Mars without proper protective clothing and equipment.<>reddit_eli5
