Why do n't we drug test for welfare ? All I find on google is a far right or far left opinion on the matter . All I want is a simple explanation as to why not ? Explain like I'm five.<>Because when some shithead drug addict fails the test and loses his benefits , it 's his three kids that do n't get to eat<>There are a few reasons why drug testing is not currently required for people to receive welfare benefits (also known as \"public assistance\"). One reason is that it is expensive to implement drug testing programs. The government would have to pay for the tests, as well as the staff to administer them and process the results. This would be a lot of money, especially if a large number of people were being tested. Another reason is that drug testing might not be very effective at achieving its goals. For example, some people who use drugs might be able to pass a drug test, while others who don't use drugs might test positive due to false positives or other issues with the testing process. This could lead to people being denied benefits unfairly. Finally, some people think that drug testing for welfare is not a good idea because it might discourage people from seeking help when they need it. If people are worried that they might be drug tested and lose their benefits if they test positive, they might be less likely to apply for assistance in the first place. This could make it harder for people who really need help to get it. So, overall, the decision not to drug test for welfare is based on a combination of cost, effectiveness, and fairness concerns.<>reddit_eli5
