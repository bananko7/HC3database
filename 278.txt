To whom should I report fraud on both of my credit cards?<>You need to run a virus scan on your computers to make sure you do not have a key-logger program running on either.  I would also think about designating one old computer to only access your bank accounts and not do anything but that.   If your computer is infected then every time you login your credit cards can be compromised.<>If you suspect that your credit cards have been used fraudulently, it is important to report the fraud as soon as possible. Here are some steps you can take:Contact your credit card issuer: Call the number on the back of your credit card or log in to your account online to report the fraud. The issuer will cancel your card and issue you a new one.File a police report: If the fraud involves a large amount of money or if you have information about the person who committed the fraud, consider filing a police report. This can be helpful in the event that the perpetrator is caught and you need to provide evidence in court.Monitor your credit reports: Check your credit reports from all three credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax) to see if there are any unauthorized charges or accounts. You can request a free copy of your credit report from each bureau once a year at annualcreditreport.com.Consider a credit freeze: If you are concerned about ongoing fraud, you may want to consider freezing your credit. A credit freeze will prevent anyone from opening new accounts in your name, but it will also prevent you from opening new accounts until you unfreeze your credit.Consider identity theft protection: If you are worried about ongoing fraud or identity theft, you may want to consider signing up for identity theft protection. These services can help you monitor your credit and personal information and alert you if there are any unusual activities.Remember to keep track of all communications and documents related to the fraud, as you may need this information for future reference.<>finance
