Correlation and Causation When I hear the phrase \" Correlation does not imply causation \" I get confused because the wikipedia page does not help . Explain like I'm five.<>Example : \" When I wear green , my favorite football team always wins ! \" Wearing green and your team winning * correlate * ( they happen at the same time ) , but wearing green does not * cause * your team to win . Some people get excited when two events happen at once , and say that one must be because the other happened , but a lot of testing has to be done first to make sure that 's true .<>Sure! I can try to explain this concept in a way that is easy to understand.\n\nCorrelation means that two things are related in some way. For example, if you eat ice cream every day and you also get a sunburn every day, you might think that eating ice cream causes sunburns. However, this is not necessarily true. There might be another reason that these two things are happening at the same time.\n\nCausation means that one thing is causing another thing to happen. In the example I just gave, if you really wanted to know if eating ice cream causes sunburns, you would have to do an experiment. You could give some people ice cream every day and see if they get sunburned, and then give other people something else to eat every day and see if they get sunburned. If the people who eat ice cream every day are more likely to get sunburned, then you might conclude that eating ice cream causes sunburns.\n\nSo, the phrase \"correlation does not imply causation\" means that just because two things seem to be related, it doesn't mean that one thing is causing the other. You need to do more research and experimentation to understand the true relationship between two things. Does that help?<>Sure!
