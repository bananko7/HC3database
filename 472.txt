What keeps successive Congresses from overturning previous laws and potentially creating policy uncertainty ? Let 's say Congress passes a controversial law . Are there any mechanisms that keep the next Congress from overturning it ? Could n't this create uncertainty when it comes to policy ? Explain like I'm five. <>Nothing , that 's how it 's supposed to work . You can make your law a Constitutional Amendment , to make it harder to overturn . This was done with the Prohibition of alcohol . That turned out to be super stupid , so that 's not going to happen again .<>There are a few mechanisms that can prevent successive Congresses from overturning previous laws. One is the principle of stare decisis, which is a legal principle that holds that courts should follow the precedents set by earlier court decisions. This means that if a law has been upheld by a court, it is more difficult for a future Congress to overturn it.\\n\\nAnother mechanism is the concept of political polarization, which means that different political parties may have different views on various issues and may be less likely to overturn laws passed by previous Congresses that align with their own political beliefs.\\n\\nFinally, the process for overturning a law is often complex and time-consuming, and it may require a significant amount of political support to do so. This can make it difficult for a future Congress to overturn a law, especially if the law is popular or has widespread support.\\n\\nOverall, while it is possible for a future Congress to overturn a law passed by a previous Congress, there are several factors that can make this difficult and create policy stability.\\n<>reddit_eli5
