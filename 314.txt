What tax-free retirement accounts are available for self-employed individuals?<>You can open a self-employed 401k, here's an example. You can deposit up to 50K (including the personal cap and the profit sharing\/matching portion).<>Self-employed individuals have several options for tax-free retirement accounts, including:Solo 401(k) or Individual 401(k): This type of 401(k) plan is designed specifically for self-employed individuals or small business owners with no employees other than a spouse. Contributions to a Solo 401(k) are tax-deductible and all earnings grow tax-free until withdrawal.SEP IRA (Simplified Employee Pension): A SEP IRA is a retirement plan that allows self-employed individuals to make tax-deductible contributions to an IRA on behalf of themselves and any employees.SIMPLE IRA (Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees): A SIMPLE IRA is a retirement plan that is similar to a SEP IRA, but it has lower contribution limits and is generally easier to set up and maintain.Roth IRA: A Roth IRA is an individual retirement account that allows contributions to be made on an after-tax basis, meaning that contributions are not tax-deductible. However, the money in a Roth IRA grows tax-free and can be withdrawn tax-free in retirement.It's important to note that there are contribution limits and income limits for each of these types of accounts. You should consult with a financial advisor or tax professional to determine which type of tax-free retirement account is best for your specific situation.<>finance
