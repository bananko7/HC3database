How do disputed debts work on credit reports?<>If you tell the collector that the claim isn't valid, they're obliged to go back to the creditor to verify it. Sometimes that gets a real person, instead of their automatic billing system, to look at the claim, and if you're right, they'll drop it.<>When a consumer disputes a debt that appears on their credit report, the credit reporting agency, also known as a credit bureau, is required to investigate the dispute. This process is governed by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), which sets out certain rights and responsibilities for consumers and credit bureaus when it comes to credit reporting.Here is a general overview of how disputed debts work on credit reports:The consumer disputes a debt: If a consumer believes that a debt listed on their credit report is incorrect or that they do not owe the debt, they can dispute the debt with the credit bureau. This can be done online, by phone, or in writing.The credit bureau investigates the dispute: When a credit bureau receives a dispute, it is required to investigate the claim and determine whether the information on the credit report is accurate. This may involve contacting the creditor or debt collector that reported the debt to verify the information.The credit bureau updates the credit report: If the credit bureau determines that the information on the credit report is accurate, it will not make any changes to the report. However, if the credit bureau finds that the information is inaccurate or incomplete, it must remove or correct the information on the credit report.It's important to note that disputing a debt on a credit report does not necessarily mean that the consumer does not owe the debt. It simply means that the consumer is challenging the accuracy of the information on the credit report. If the credit bureau determines that the information is accurate, the consumer may still be responsible for paying the debt.If you have questions about a disputed debt on your credit report, it may be helpful to speak with a consumer law attorney or a credit counselor. They can provide more information about your rights and options.<>finance
