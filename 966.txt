Why is the letter ' W ' pronounced \" double u \" and not \" double v \" ? I 've always wondered this . Explain like I'm five.<>* * tl;dr * * English chose ... poorly --- Long before English and Spanish and French and pretty much all modern languages , there was Latin . Latin is where most languages you encounter get their alphabet , that 's English , French , Portuguese and a whole bunch of others . Thing is , Latin at its beginning did n't have all those letters we use today . It only had these letters : A B C D E F Z^ * H I K L M N O P Q R S T V X You 'll notice a few letters missing : G , J , U , W and Y. Let 's focus on J and U first and we 'll get back to W later^ ` * * ` . In classical Latin , these letters were replaced by I and V respectively so instead of writing Julius ( As in Gaius Julius Caesar ) you would write IVLIVS^ ` * * * ` . That 's the first part of the explanation : * * Long ago , U and V were the same letter * * Later , once the Roman Empire spread across Europe , the natives figured out the Romans brought with them an awesome alphabet and figured they might as well use it to transcribe their own language . Bit of a problem , though . What letter can you use to represent the germanic \/w\/ sound ( the one in ` what ` ) . Go ahead and look , I 'll wait . Yeah , that 's not it^ ` * * * * ` The solution is simply to add a new letter . Let 's keep things simple and just double up a letter . Let 's choose V^ ` * * * * * ` . Wonderful ! We got ourselves a new letter . We just need to give it a name . Now , we could give it a boring name like \" Wuh \" , but we 're germano - romans , we can be even more boring than that : Since we just put two latin Vs together , we 'll just call it double - V. And now , we have a problem . Remember above how U and V used to be the same letter ? Turns out they still are . Well , for now let 's just call it * double - v - that - is - sometimes - a - u - because - romans * Flash - forward to when people decided that IVLIVS looks silly . No problem , we 'll just invent U and fix up the words that need fixing up . > . > . > . And then we come across * double - v - that - is - sometimes - a - u - because - romans * . Well , we can either call it Double - V or Double - U. As it turns out , most every language went with the former option . Clearly , the letter is a pair of Vs together . English went the other way and called its version of W double - U. Basically , it goes back to Latin when U and V were one and the same letter . When the letters split up , English ended up choosing ... poorly . Other languages like French and Spanish call their W Double - V --- ` * ` Z is so early because that 's where the Greeks put their Zeta . It was later removed and replaced by G ` * * ` Explanation for the other two letters : There 's no G because the Romans used C which was inspired by the greek Gamma . Y and Z ( which was removed at some point , remember ) came later so the Romans could spell greek loanwords ` * * * ` Latin did n't have small letters either . This is ` ivlivs ` if you could n't read it above ` * * * * ` Unless you said to double up a V , in which case bravo , that 's precisely it ` * * * * * ` Why ? I do n't know . I guess two U sounds ( I mean sounds like in soup , not Youyou ) together sounds a bit like \/w\/ if you 're really trying.^ ` * * * * * * ` ` * * * * * * ` I like footnotes . Do n't you ?<>The letter \"W\" is pronounced \"double u\" because it is derived from the letter \"U.\" In the English alphabet, \"W\" was originally just a variant of the letter \"U,\" and it was used to represent the sound of \"uu\" or \"w\" in words like \"uuater\" or \"wool.\" Eventually, the letter \"W\" was distinguished from \"U\" and became a separate letter in the English alphabet. However, it still retained the pronunciation of \"double u\" because of its origins. So, even though it might seem like the letter \"W\" should be pronounced \"double v,\" it is actually pronounced \"double u\" because of its history and its place in the alphabet.<>reddit_eli5
