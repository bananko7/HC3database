Is it true that Income Tax was created to finance troops for World War I?<>Income tax was seen as a way to exploit the revenues available from the rapidly expanding ranks of people with mid to high incomes. It was initially targeted at the very wealthy. Previously, most Federal revenues came from excise taxes and tariffs, both of which have many negative economic effects, leave the government with limited revenue generating ability and bring a host of international and domestic political problems.  Since the successful implementation of the income tax required a constitutional amendment, it is very unlikely that anyone at the time seriously considered the income tax a temporary measure.<>Income tax was not created specifically to finance troops for World War I, but it was introduced in the United States in order to help fund the country's involvement in the war. The income tax was first implemented in the United States in 1913 with the passage of the 16th Amendment to the Constitution, which granted Congress the power to levy a tax on income. The tax was originally intended to be a temporary measure to help finance the country's involvement in World War I, but it has remained a permanent feature of the U.S. tax system since its inception.Income tax was not the only measure that the government used to fund its involvement in World War I. The government also borrowed money through the issuance of bonds, and it increased tariffs on imported goods to raise revenue. Additionally, the government implemented a number of other taxes, including the war profits tax and the excess profits tax, which were specifically intended to help fund the war effort.<>finance
