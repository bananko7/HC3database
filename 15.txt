How do military aircraft war games work ? Obviously the pilots ca n't actually shoot each other down right ? How are fighter jet win \/ loss ratios figured out ? Explain like I'm five.<>Plane A has missile lock on another plane B , the computer on plane B senses a missile lock and registers a missile hit . Yea just like lasertag<>Military aircraft war games are exercises where military pilots practice fighting against each other in simulated combat situations. The pilots fly their aircraft as if they were in a real war, but they do not actually shoot at each other. Instead, they use special equipment that simulates the effects of being hit by a missile or gunfire. To figure out who won or lost a war game, the pilots and their aircraft are given certain \"points\" based on their actions during the exercise. For example, a pilot who successfully \"shoots down\" another aircraft might be awarded points, while a pilot who gets \"shot down\" themselves might lose points. At the end of the exercise, the points are totaled up and the pilot or team with the most points is declared the winner. It's important to note that war games are just exercises and are not the same as real combat. The main purpose of war games is to help pilots practice and improve their skills, rather than to fight a real war.<>Military aircraft war games are exercises where military pilots practice fighting against each other in simulated combat situations.
