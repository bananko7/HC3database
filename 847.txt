Why can Robin Hood offer trading without commissions?<>They mostly make money off of the spread between your order and the spread of the buy and sell currently in the market. As others have previously explained, their buy\/sell spreads are a little lacklustre.<>Robinhood is a stock trading platform that allows users to buy and sell stocks and other securities without charging a commission. Instead of charging a commission on each trade, Robinhood makes money by selling its users' order flow to high-frequency trading firms and by offering premium features for a fee.Some critics have argued that this business model may create conflicts of interest, as the firms that are buying the order flow may be motivated to trade in a way that is not in the best interests of Robinhood's users. Additionally, the lack of commission fees may encourage more frequent trading, which can be costly for individual investors due to the impact of trading fees and spreads on the overall cost of a trade.<>finance
