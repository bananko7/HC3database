Dividends Growing Faster than Cost of Capital<>I don't think the method falls short, it's the premise that is wrong. If the dividend stream really did grow faster than the cost of capital indefinitely, eventually the company behind the share would become larger than the entire economy. Logically, at some point, the growth must slow down.<>If a company's dividends are growing faster than its cost of capital, it generally indicates that the company is generating excess cash flow and is able to pay out a portion of its profits to shareholders in the form of dividends. This can be a positive sign for investors, as it suggests that the company is financially healthy and has a strong business model.However, it is important to note that a company's dividends should not grow faster than its ability to generate profits. If this happens, the company may eventually become unable to sustain its dividend payments and may need to cut or eliminate dividends altogether. It is also important to consider the company's overall financial health and its future prospects when evaluating whether its dividends are growing at a sustainable rate.<>finance
