The first five digits of your ZIP code might identify your city and state, but the four-digit extension helps the USPS to know exactly which neighborhood you live in. This can be especially helpful if your neighborhood has a lot of similar-looking buildings or if the streets are confusing to navigate. The four-digit extension is also useful for businesses that receive a large volume of mail, as it can help the USPS to quickly and accurately deliver mail to the correct department or individual within the company. Overall, the four-digit extension helps the USPS to deliver mail more efficiently and accurately, which is important for ensuring that people and businesses receive their mail in a timely manner.<>reddit_eli5
