[ Source ] ( URL_0 )<>Teeth grinding, also known as bruxism, is a common condition that can occur during sleep or while awake. It is when a person clinches, grinds, or gnashes their teeth together. Some people grind their teeth because of stress or anxiety, while others do it because of an abnormal bite or misaligned teeth. It can also be caused by sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea. \nBruxism can cause tooth damage, such as chips or cracks, and can also cause jaw pain and headaches. If your roommate is grinding their teeth, they may want to see a dentist or doctor to help identify the cause and find a solution. In the meantime, they can try wearing a mouthguard at night to protect their teeth and reduce the grinding noise.<>reddit_eli5
