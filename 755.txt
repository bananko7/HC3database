Should the price of fuel in Australia at this point be so high?<>(disclaimer: I don't answer specifically about Australia) As long as people don't question car usage and urban sprawl, and thus are willing to pay a premium for being stuck in traffic jams every working day, I don't see any reason why fuel producers wouldn't increase their prices. Given increasing demand from China and other rapidly growing countries, given state of remaining world resources, I think that fuel is a bargain nowadays.<>The price of fuel in Australia, like in any other country, is determined by a variety of factors, including the cost of production, transportation, and distribution, as well as market demand and supply. Additionally, taxes and other government policies can also impact the price of fuel. It is difficult to say whether the current price of fuel in Australia is too high or not without more information about the specific market conditions and factors that are influencing it.<>finance
