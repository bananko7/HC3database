The Bilderberg Conventions What they are really ... And then maybe some conspiracies about what might actually happen at them Explain like I'm five.<>It is a very secretive get together where high power business figures get together with European royalty and various government figures ( mostly Western ) to discuss global issues \/ policy in an informal setting without media scrutiny . Now , you can probably see where these kind of people getting together with all of this secrecy leads to rampant speculation about what goes on there . Conspiracy theorists believe this is one of the main get - togethers of the New World Order where capitalists and governments come together to plot how to control us all . Conspiracies aside , it should make us all a little uncomfortable that big business and national governments have a conference like this where they get together , talk informally , share their goals and strategies and generally get real cozy with one and other .<>The Bilderberg Conventions are annual meetings that bring together politicians, business leaders, and other influential people from around the world to discuss a variety of topics. The meetings are invitation-only and are held in private, which means that only the people who are invited are allowed to attend and the discussions are not made public. There are many different theories and conspiracies about what might happen at the Bilderberg Conventions. Some people believe that the meetings are used to plot and plan secret deals and agreements between powerful individuals and organizations. Others believe that the meetings are used to control and manipulate global events and decisions. However, it's important to note that there is no evidence to support these theories, and the Bilderberg Conventions have always been described by their organizers as a forum for informal discussions on a wide range of issues.<>reddit_eli5
