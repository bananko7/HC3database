How did organisms develop senses ? So I 've been wondering how organisms developed the 5 senses . For example how did they evolve to have eyes and ears or even know that there was something to see or hear in the first place ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Here is a cool video describing the evolution of the eye : URL_0<>Organisms developed senses through a process called evolution by natural selection. This means that over time, certain traits or characteristics that helped an organism survive and reproduce became more common in a population. For example, let's say that there were two animals, and one had eyes and the other didn't. If the animal with eyes was better able to see predators and find food, it would be more likely to survive and have babies. Those babies would also have eyes, and they would also be more likely to survive and have babies. This would continue for many generations, until almost all the animals in that population had eyes. In this way, eyes and other senses developed to help organisms better survive in their environment. Does that make sense?<>reddit_eli5
