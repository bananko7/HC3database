How do CEOs like Elon Musk , pay their bills on only a $ 1 a year salary ? I 've heard a lot of CEOs are starting to only take $ 1 annually , how do they pay for things then ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Because that 's not how much they get paid . The get $ 1 a year in * * salary * * . He also gets a few * * million * * a year in bonuses , stock incentives , dividends and other such payments . Trust me , he 's got plenty of money . The $ 1 is basically so he can still be the CEO since its illegal to pay someone $ 0 ( since that 's slavery ) .<>CEOs like Elon Musk are paid in many ways other than just their salary. For example, they may receive bonuses, stock options, and other forms of compensation from the company they work for. These forms of compensation can be very valuable and can help to make up for the low salary. Additionally, many CEOs have other sources of income, such as investments or businesses they own. So, even though they may only be paid a salary of $1 per year, they have other sources of money that they can use to pay their bills.<>reddit_eli5
