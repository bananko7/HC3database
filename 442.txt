Why do people have accents ? Just a thing i 've always wondered . Please explain like I'm five.<>It 's a natural evolution of the language . It 's exactly the same law that explains the different languages : on day someone starts speaking just a bit differently , because that 's how he is , and then his children will do the same , his neighbours may take some of his expressions or way of speaking , and then it amplifies on each generation , until it becomes a completely different accent . At least that 's how it was explained to me .<>Accents are the way people pronounce words in a particular language, and they can be influenced by many different factors. One of the main reasons people have accents is because they learn a language from a young age in a specific place, where the language is spoken in a certain way. This is called a \"regional accent.\" For example, someone who grows up in the United States might speak English with an American accent, while someone who grows up in Britain might speak English with a British accent. This is because the way people pronounce words and the sounds they use to make words are different in different parts of the world. Another reason people might have an accent is because they learn a language later in life, after they have already developed their own way of speaking. This is called an \"acquired accent.\" For example, someone who grows up speaking one language and then learns another language as an adult might have an accent when speaking the second language. Accents can also be influenced by the language or languages that a person speaks at home, as well as the culture and environment they grow up in. So, in short, people have accents because of the way they learn to speak a language and the different influences on their speech.<>reddit_eli5
