Is the Earth getting bigger ? If so , why ? We have to dig down to find artifacts from previous generations , but surely we 're not adding that much material to the Earth ? Explain like I'm five.<>The Earth is getting slightly larger because of meteorites hitting the surface , however the volume that the meteorites add is minuscule . The reason we have to dig for artifacts is more to do with the shifting of the Earths surface through natural erosion , human intervention , weather etc .<>The Earth is not getting bigger. The Earth is made up of solid rock and some liquid, like the oceans. The solid rock part of the Earth is called the \"crust,\" and it is not getting bigger. The Earth is also not getting bigger because we are not adding very much material to it.\r\n\r\nSometimes, people find old things underground because over a very long time, the dirt and sand on the ground can pile up and cover up old things. The Earth is very old, so this has had a lot of time to happen. But the Earth itself is not getting bigger.<>reddit_eli5
