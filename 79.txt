How to calculate the closing price percentage change for a stock?
The previous day's close on Thursday 10th October was 5,000.00 The close on Friday 11th October is 5,025.92 So the gain on Friday was 25.92 (5025.92 - 5000) or 0.52% (25.92\/5000 x 100%). No mystery!
To calculate the closing price percentage change for a stock, you can use the following formula:(closing price - previous closing price) \/ previous closing price * 100For example, let's say the closing price of a stock on Monday is $100, and the closing price on Tuesday is $110. To calculate the percentage change from Monday to Tuesday, you would use the following formula:(110 - 100) \/ 100 * 100 = 10 \/ 100 * 100 = 10%This means that the closing price of the stock increased by 10% from Monday to Tuesday.If you want to calculate the percentage change over a longer period of time, you can simply use the same formula, but replace the previous closing price with the closing price at the start of the period that you're interested in. For example, if you wanted to calculate the percentage change in the stock's closing price over the past month, you would use the closing price at the start of the month as the previous closing price in the formula.
