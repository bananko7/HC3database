What 's the difference between decriminalizing something and just making it legal ? Like marijuana , for example . Please explain like I'm five.<>There are things you can get a fine for ( like parking after the meter expires ) that are not \" criminal \" . That is , they are not a felony or misdemeanor . Sometimes they are called \" infractions \" or \" civil violations \" . They are still illegal , but you ca n't get arrested for them , and paying the fine does n't make you a \" criminal \" or give you a \" criminal record \" . Essentially , the penalty is low and there 's less social stigma that would interfere with getting a job or public assistance . ( edit , for further clarity :) So when they talk about \" decriminalizing \" marijuana possession , they mean making the penalty like a parking ticket , but still keeping it illegal .<>Decriminalizing something means that it is no longer a criminal offense to possess or use it. This means that people who are caught with the substance will not face criminal charges or be put in jail. Instead, they may face a fine or other punishment, such as drug education or rehabilitation. Making something legal means that it is allowed and not against the law. This means that people can possess and use it without fear of being arrested or punished. For example, marijuana is illegal in many places. This means that if you are caught with marijuana, you could go to jail. If marijuana were decriminalized, you might still get in trouble if you were caught with it, but you would not face criminal charges. If marijuana were legalized, it would be completely legal to possess and use it.<>reddit_eli5
