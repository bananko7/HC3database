Why can we not harvest energy from lightening ? Maybe I have n't slept yet . Explain like I'm five.<>Not only does the energy come in bursts , it comes in incredibly large amounts - basically , we can not store store that much energy that fast or make sure that the energy does n't simply fry the equipment we 're using . A battery takes time to recharge , and if you try and recharge it too fast , it will simply break . The energy in a stroke of lightning is \" too fast \" for every kind of battery we have .<>Lightning is a natural electrical discharge that occurs when electricity builds up in a cloud and is then released. This discharge can be very powerful and can produce a lot of energy. However, it is also very dangerous and can cause damage to buildings and other structures, as well as harm to people. It is possible to capture some of the energy from lightning and use it to generate electricity, but this is not currently a practical way to generate electricity on a large scale. The main reason for this is that lightning is very unpredictable and it is difficult to control when and where it will strike. This makes it hard to set up the equipment needed to capture the energy from lightning in a way that is safe and reliable. Another reason that it is not practical to harvest energy from lightning is that the energy from a single lightning strike is usually not enough to power a large number of homes or businesses. To generate a significant amount of electricity from lightning, we would need to capture the energy from a very large number of lightning strikes, which would be very difficult and expensive to do. Overall, while it is possible to capture some of the energy from lightning, it is not currently a practical way to generate electricity due to the difficulties and risks involved.<>reddit_eli5
