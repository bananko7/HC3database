Why do people say \" my partner \" instead of bf , gf , spouse ? I 've noticed that many people now refer to their significant other as their \" partner , \" even in a heterosexual context . What gives ? Does it mean something different ? Please explain like I'm five.<>There are some situations in which \" partner \" may be the most appropriate word to use . Consider a person who is not married , but who has lived together with a man for 8 years , co - owns a house with him , makes joint financial decisions with him , and where they take each care of one another 's health problems . To say \" he is my husband \" is incorrect since they are not married , but to call such a person a mere \" boyfriend \" implies a much less serious and permanent relationship than they have . \" Partner \" is more accurate than either of these .<>People might say \"partner\" instead of \"boyfriend,\" \"girlfriend,\" or \"spouse\" for a variety of reasons. One reason might be that the word \"partner\" can be more inclusive and doesn't specify a particular gender. This can be useful for people who are in same-sex relationships, as well as those who are transgender or non-binary and don't feel comfortable being referred to using traditional gender-specific terms. Another reason might be that some people simply prefer the word \"partner\" because it can feel more modern or less traditional. Some people might also find it more neutral or less formal than terms like \"husband\" or \"wife.\" So, to sum up, \"partner\" is a word that people use to refer to someone they are romantically or sexually involved with. It can be used in place of words like \"boyfriend,\" \"girlfriend,\" or \"spouse,\" and it can be a more inclusive and less gender-specific way of referring to someone.<>reddit_eli5
