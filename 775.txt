The Arrow Paradox I read an interesting thing on Wikipedia about this thing called the Arrow Paradox , which somehow said motion was impossible . Would someone be kind enough to explain it ? I really like these kinds of things . Explain like I'm five.<>If everything is motionless at every instant , and time is entirely composed of instants , then motion is impossible .<>Sure! The Arrow Paradox is a thought experiment that was first proposed by the ancient Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea. It's a way of trying to understand what we mean when we talk about motion, and it suggests that motion might not be possible at all.\r\n\r\nImagine an arrow flying through the air. At any given moment, the arrow is in a specific place. Let's say that at time t1, the arrow is at the position x1. At time t2, the arrow is at position x2.\r\n\r\nNow, Zeno argued that in order for the arrow to move from x1 to x2, it must first get halfway there, to a position called x1.5. And in order to get to x1.5, it must first get halfway there, to a position called x1.75. And in order to get to x1.75, it must first get halfway there, to a position called x1.875. And so on.\r\n\r\nAccording to Zeno, this means that in order for the arrow to move at all, it must first travel an infinite number of distances, which is impossible. Therefore, he concluded, motion must be an illusion and is impossible.\r\n\r\nOf course, we know that motion is possible, so Zeno's argument must be flawed somehow. Can you think of a way to explain why his argument might not be correct?<>reddit_eli5
