Is Lucid Dreaming Real ? Please give me real answers on this . The thing with the internet is there 's a lot of people who make up stuff . edit : Is there any scientific evidence backing up Lucid Dreaming ? Please explain like I'm five.
Yes , and it is as awesome as you can imagine . Most of my dreaming is lucid , and I actually choose to do things , like \" If I make a running start , I can fly . \" And then I am flying . But if I try to change too much of the surroundings , I wake up . There is a downside . My mother died last year . She shows up in my dreams almost every night . At least get to tell her how much I miss her . And I hug her , and then I tell her that I know I am dreaming , because I was there when she died . Still , my lucid dreaming is amazing . I feel pretty lucky .
Yes, lucid dreaming is real. It is a type of dreaming where the person is aware that they are dreaming and may even be able to control the dream to some extent. There is scientific evidence to support the existence of lucid dreaming. For example, studies have shown that people who have lucid dreams often have specific brain wave patterns and eye movements during the dream that are different from those during normal dreaming or being awake. These brain and eye movement patterns can be measured and studied by scientists. To understand lucid dreaming better, it may be helpful to understand how dreaming works. When we sleep, our brain goes through different stages. During the rapid eye movement (REM) stage, which is when most dreaming occurs, the brain is more active and the body is paralyzed to prevent us from acting out our dreams. When we have a lucid dream, our brain is still in the REM stage, but we become aware that we are dreaming and are able to control the dream to some extent. So, to answer your question, lucid dreaming is real and there is scientific evidence to support its existence.
