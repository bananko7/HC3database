Why is there so much controversy in what you call The Republic of Macedonia \/ FYROM ? Please can someone explain why there is so much tension in what you call it and how it came to this ? Thanks Explain like I'm five. <>It comes down to who \" owns \" the history of Alexander the Great and the cultural legacy and identity that comes with it . With it comes the question of WHO were the Macedonians ? Were they Greeks ? Were they \" barbarians \" who adopted enough of Ancient Greek culture to pass as Greek ? There are also broader questions of culture and history and country : can X culture exist outside of X country ? Do the people of Modern X Country have a monopoly on Ancient X culture despite thousands of years of history changing the region ? How linked together are culture and history ? How are our understandings of ancient cultures shaped by the bias of sources from back then ? Greece views Alexander 's Kingdom \/ Empire of Macedonia and its subsequent successor states as part of the cultural heritage of Ancient Greece and therefore their history . They claim that the people who live in the Republic of Macedonia \/ FYROM now are not the same people who lived there in Alexander 's time and are not culturally Greek and so do n't have any claim to that heritage . It 's not an inaccurate view : in the 5th\/6th century , there were a wave of migrations of Slavic tribes into the area resulting in a country that has a Slavic ( not Greek ) culture and speaks a Slavic language . They point to the fact that the majority of historical records that describe Macedonians describe them as Greek . Modern Macedonians often refute that a lot of these records come from external sources ( ex , the Romans ) who tended to lump cultural groups together under one name and were not aware of \/ interested in the differences that the people in that group saw amongst themselves . Modern Macedonians from the Republic \/ FYROM claim that the Ancient Macedonians differed culturally and ethnically enough from the Ancient Greeks that Modern Greeks do n't have a monopoly on Macedonian identity . One theory posits , for example , that they were a tribe from the north of Greece proper that underwent Hellenization and adopted elements Greek culture while preserving some of their own . Another argues that they were an example of a more \" archaic \" Greek society and the differences were as a result of cultural practices that the Ancient Greeks of the southern city - states had lost . Either way , modern Macedonians from the Republic \/ FYROM believe that this gives them just as much a right to claim Alexander 's heritage as the Modern Greeks . They point to some historical records that demonstrate that the Ancient Greeks themselves considered Macedonians \" separate \" from them , but Modern Greeks argue that that was just as a result of political rivalry between Macedonia and the southern city - states . Modern Macedonians also point to instances of Macedonian Slavic culture that echo ancient Macedonian culture as evidence that the Slavic tribes who migrated in melded with the existing culture rather than invaded \/ exterminated it . Adding confusion is the fact that there 's a region within Greece that 's called Macedon ( also part of the ancient kingdom ) and that there are ethnic Greeks in Greece who identify as Macedonian . Basically , the region of Ancient Macedon and , more broadly speaking , the idea of cultures do n't fit neatly within modern national borders . Thousands of years of history and war and migration and bias of primary sources that describe the Macedonians complicate things . Doubly so when there 's certainly an emotional investment in the debate on the part of all involved .<>The Republic of Macedonia, which is a country located in Southeast Europe, has been the subject of controversy and tension because of its name. The name \"Macedonia\" is also used by a region in northern Greece, and the two countries have had a long-standing dispute over who has the right to use the name.\\n\\nThe Republic of Macedonia gained independence from Yugoslavia in 1991 and chose the name \"Macedonia\" for its new country. However, the name was disputed by Greece, which argued that the name should only be used by its own region of Macedonia and that the use of the name by the Republic of Macedonia implied a territorial claim on the Greek region.\\n\\nAs a result, the international community, including the United Nations, has referred to the Republic of Macedonia as the \"Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\" or \"FYROM\" as a temporary measure until the dispute is resolved.\\n\\nThe dispute has caused tension between the two countries and has also affected the Republic of Macedonia's ability to join international organizations such as the European Union and NATO, as some members have refused to accept the country's membership until the name dispute is resolved.\\n\\nDespite efforts to resolve the dispute, it remains an ongoing issue, and the two countries are still working to find a solution.<>reddit_eli5
