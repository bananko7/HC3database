Why do different cheeses taste different when milk does not ? Mozzarella vs Parmesan Please explain like I'm five.<>I think it has to do with the different techniques used to make the cheese , i.e. different conditions under which the milk is fermented . Also different types of milk , from say different breeds of cows , probably do taste slightly different .<>Cheese is made from milk, but it tastes different from milk because of the way it is made. To make cheese, milk is first pasteurized, which means it is heated to a high temperature to kill any harmful bacteria. Then, a special type of bacteria called \"starter culture\" is added to the milk. This bacteria helps to turn the milk into cheese. After the starter culture is added, the milk is allowed to sit for a while to give the bacteria time to work. During this time, the bacteria break down the lactose (a type of sugar) in the milk, which changes the flavor of the cheese. Different types of cheese are made using different types of starter culture, which is why they all taste different. For example, mozzarella cheese is made using a starter culture that gives it a mild, slightly sweet flavor. Parmesan cheese is made using a different starter culture that gives it a sharper, more tangy flavor. Other factors that can affect the flavor of cheese include the type of milk used (such as cow's milk, goat's milk, or sheep's milk), the age of the cheese (older cheese tends to have a stronger flavor), and the way the cheese is stored and aged (some cheeses are aged for a long time, which can also affect their flavor).<>reddit_eli5
