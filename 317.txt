How the grass is still alive after being covered by snow for months ? Since it ca n't get any sunlight , how does it all not just die off ? Explain like I'm five.<>There is a rule in chemistry , for every 10oC you raise the temp of a reaction , you double the reaction rate . The reverse is true , the colder , the slower the reaction . Since it is so cold in winter , the metabolic reactions ( the plant cells eating ) are so slow , that a small amount of food is enough to hold the plant for the whole winter .<>Grass is able to survive being covered by snow for a few reasons.\n\nFirst, grass is a type of plant that is adapted to survive in cold weather. This means that it has special ways of protecting itself from the cold and from lack of sunlight.\n\nSecond, grass has a special way of storing energy. It takes in sunlight through its leaves and uses it to make food, which it stores in its roots. This stored energy helps the grass survive when it doesn't have access to sunlight, such as when it is covered by snow.\n\nFinally, grass has a shallow root system, which means that its roots don't grow very deep into the ground. This allows the grass to access water and nutrients from the top layer of soil, even when the soil is frozen or covered by snow.\n\nSo, even though the grass can't get any sunlight while it is covered by snow, it is still able to survive by using the energy it stored in its roots and by accessing water and nutrients from the top layer of soil.<>reddit_eli5
