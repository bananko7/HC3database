why do we have to \" safely remove \" USB devices ? Not really ELI5 , I 'm a senior CS major , but we do n't really learn about stuff like this so I 'd love an explanation . Thanks ! Explain like I'm five.<>[ here ] ( URL_0 ) is a good explanation . tl;dr osx and linux uses write caching which means the OS waits until a decent amount of data is queued to do the writing since many little jobs is more expensive \/ slower than a few large writes . windows is more discriminative on ejectable drives<>When you connect a USB device to your computer, the computer reads and writes data to the device. If you simply unplug the device without \"safely removing\" it first, the data being transferred between the device and the computer may be lost or corrupted. This can cause problems, such as data loss or errors on the device. To avoid these problems, you should \"safely remove\" the device before unplugging it. This tells the operating system to stop reading and writing data to the device and to close any open files on the device. Once the device is \"safely removed,\" it can be unplugged without causing any problems. I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.<>reddit_eli5
