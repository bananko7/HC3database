When we eat food, our bodies use the energy from the calories to do things like move, think, and grow. Some foods have more calories than others because they contain more energy. For example, foods that are high in fat, sugar, or protein tend to have more calories than foods that are low in these nutrients. To stay healthy, it's important to pay attention to the number of calories that you eat and try to balance your intake of calories with the amount of energy that you use. This can help you maintain a healthy weight and have enough energy to do the things you enjoy.<>reddit_eli5
