Why do I root for an anti - hero or villain on television that I would hate in the real world ? This quetion * may * be Breaking Bad by inspired . Explain like I'm five.<>A. You can bolster or ignore events more easily in a fictional world because what happens in it does n't really matter . Even in real life I do n't care that much about what Ted Bundy did , for example , because it was done to other people far away . And yes , that really is as callous as it sounds . B. You fallow the anti - hero around and get to know them , so you can sympathize with their actions more . C. Shady emotional manipulation . Movies are magic . Music , camera angles , lighting , the situation , who says what and how . The writer is God . And if the piece of art is engrossing enough then you will trance out as the movie hypnotizes you into believing what the writer wants you to believe .<>It's completely normal to root for an anti-hero or villain on television, even if you would hate them in real life. There are a few reasons why this might happen.\r\n\r\nFirst, when we watch television shows or movies, we are able to separate what is happening on screen from our own lives. We know that the characters and events we see are not real, so it's easier to suspend our disbelief and enjoy the story without worrying about the consequences of what we are seeing.\r\n\r\nSecond, anti-heroes and villains often have compelling storylines and character development that make them more interesting to watch than traditional heroes. They often have complex motivations and flaws that make them relatable, even if their actions are not always admirable.\r\n\r\nFinally, it's also possible that we might root for an anti-hero or villain because we want to see them succeed despite their flaws. We might feel that they are misunderstood or that they have been dealt a bad hand in life, and we want to see them overcome their challenges and find redemption.\r\n\r\nOverall, it's okay to root for an anti-hero or villain on television, as long as we remember that their actions and behaviors are not acceptable in real life.<>reddit_eli5
