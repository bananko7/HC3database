What is the difference between all the Christian denominations ? Why are their so many denominations of Christanity and what makes one different from another ? Explain like I'm five.<>I come from the Netherlands . Basically every time someone does not agree with one another on the bible they create a new church with a new name with people who agree with their opinion<>Christian denominations are different groups of Christians who have slightly different beliefs or practices. Just like how there are many different types of houses or schools, there are also many different types of Christian churches.\r\n\r\nOne reason there are so many denominations is because Christianity has been around for a long time, and over the years, people have had different ideas about what they believe and how they should worship. Sometimes, these differences become so big that they can't all be part of the same church, so they start their own denomination.\r\n\r\nSome common differences between denominations include how they interpret the Bible, what they believe about God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit, and how they worship. For example, some churches might have a more traditional style of worship with hymns and formal prayers, while others might have a more relaxed and casual style with contemporary music and a less structured service.\r\n\r\nIt's important to remember that even though there are many different denominations, all Christians believe in the same basic things: that God loves us and that Jesus died for our sins so that we can have a relationship with God.<>reddit_eli5
