What does it mean that stocks are “memoryless”?<>It means price movements in the past do not affect price movements in the future. Think of the situation of a coin, if you flip it once, and then you flip it a second time, the results are independent of each other. If the first time, you flipped a HEAD, it does not mean that the coin will remember it, and produce a TAIL the second time. This is the meaning of \"memoryless\". FYI, stock markets are clearly not memoryless. It is just an assumption for academic purposes.<>In the context of stock prices, the term \"memoryless\" refers to the assumption that past price movements do not provide any information about future price movements. This assumption is often used in statistical models of stock price behavior.The concept of memorylessness comes from the mathematical concept of a memoryless process, which is a type of stochastic process (a process involving randomness) in which the future behavior of the process is independent of its past behavior. In other words, the probability of an event occurring in the future is not influenced by the events that have occurred in the past.In the context of stock prices, this means that the future price of a stock is not influenced by its past price movements. Instead, the future price is determined by a combination of factors such as the company's financial performance, market conditions, and investor sentiment.It is important to note that the assumption of memorylessness is just that – an assumption. In reality, stock prices may be influenced by past events, and it is possible to use historical data to make informed predictions about future stock price movements. However, the assumption of memorylessness is often used as a starting point for modeling and analyzing stock price behavior.<>finance
