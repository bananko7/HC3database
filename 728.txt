What 's the difference between sadism and schadenfreude ? Big discussion happening here . The most helpful answers will provide an example for each that use similar situations but highlight how one difference changes the appropriate word to describe the feeling . Thanks ! Explain like I'm five.<>The only real difference in my mind is \" action \" . Sadism is gaining pleasure from * * inflicting * * pain on others . Schadenfreude is gaining pleasure from * * seeing * * others in pain . So sadism is cutting off a guy 's fingers one at a time to listen to him scream . Schadenfreude is laughing when a waiter drops a full plate of dishes . Both are laughing at other 's misfortune ... but one is active involvement and the other is passive .<>,"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5"}
