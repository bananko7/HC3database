How there can be new dog breeds classified each year ? I keep seeing every year that there are \" new \" dog breeds . How \/ why does this happen ? Explain like I'm five.<>Are they truly new breeds or simply rarer breeds that are getting noticed ? I own two boerboels , a mastiff breed originating in South Africa . They are becoming more popular in the US ( where I am ) . I think the AKC has accepted them a a breed finally , but the process takes a long time .<>Sure! New dog breeds are created when people decide to breed two dogs together with the goal of creating a new type of dog that has certain characteristics or traits. For example, some people may want to create a new breed of dog that is very small and fluffy, so they might breed a small dog with a fluffy dog to see if they can get puppies that are small and fluffy.\r\n\r\nSometimes, a new breed of dog is created by accident, when two dogs of different breeds happen to breed and produce puppies that are a mix of both breeds. In these cases, the puppies may have characteristics that are different from either of the parent breeds, and people may decide to try to create a new breed of dog by breeding these puppies with each other or with other dogs that have similar characteristics.\r\n\r\nTo be recognized as a new breed of dog, a group of people who are interested in the breed will usually have to work together to establish a set of standards for the breed, which describe the breed's appearance, temperament, and other characteristics. They will also have to prove that the breed is distinct from other breeds and that it is possible to consistently produce puppies with the desired characteristics. Once they have done this, they can apply to have the breed recognized by a dog breed club or organization, such as the American Kennel Club. If the breed is accepted, it will be added to the list of recognized breeds and can participate in dog shows and other events.<>reddit_eli5
