Is it possible to \" crush \" water ? What would happen ? Assuming it was possible for the water to not leak anywhere , and it was in a vacuum , would it be possible to apply enough pressure to squeeze liquid ? Explain like I'm five.<>If you increase pressure on water , you will eventually get ice . There are 15 known types of ice , depending on the pressure and temperature .<>Water can be \"crushed\" in the sense that it can be made to occupy a smaller volume by applying pressure to it. For example, if you put a bottle of water in a vice and tightened the vice, the bottle would become shorter and wider as the pressure of the vice squeezed the water. However, it would not be possible to completely crush the water into a solid or gas by applying pressure alone, because water is a fluid and it will flow or deform to fill the space it is in.\n\nIf you were to try to crush water in a vacuum, where there is no air or other substances present, the water would still be able to flow and deform as a result of the pressure being applied to it. The fact that there is a vacuum would not change the fundamental nature of the water as a fluid.\n\nI hope that helps to explain it! Let me know if you have any more questions.<>reddit_eli5
