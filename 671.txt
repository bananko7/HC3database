This could have been caused by contact with your wife's discharge or by the use of a lubricant during intercourse.\n\nTo address the symptoms, you can try the following steps:\n\nClean the affected area gently with warm water and mild soap. Avoid using scented soaps or detergents, as they can further irritate the skin.\n\nDry the area thoroughly after washing.\n\nApply a thin layer of over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream to the affected area. This can help reduce inflammation and itching.\n\nAvoid intercourse until the symptoms resolve.\n\nIf the symptoms persist or worsen despite these measures, you should consider consulting a healthcare provider for further evaluation and treatment.
