This commonly thrown around math problem . Someone explain [ * * This * * ] ( URL_0 ) to me like I 'm 5 . Explain like I'm five.<>The question is just tracking the wrong thing . Why would the amount you kept plus the debt you owe add up to $ 100 ? This problem is perhaps more approachable if you use some balance - sheet - type arithmetic . Let 's start the problem over . You start out with $ 0 , and you want to buy a $ 97 shirt . You have $ 0 in assets ( no money and no shirt ) and you have $ 0 in liabilities ( you do n't owe anyone money ) . You take out $ 100 in loans . ( $ 100 in cash assets ; $ 100 in liabilities - the money you owe . ) You buy the shirt . ( $ 100 in total assets - $ 97 shirt and $ 3 cash ; $ 100 liabilities - you have n't repaid anyone . ) You give your parents back $ 2 , and keep $ 1 . You now have $ 98 in total assets ( $ 97 shirt ; $ 1 cash)and $ 98 in liabilities .<>I'm sorry, but it looks like you have provided an incomplete sentence or phrase.
