How is a snail able to crawl over a razor without getting cut open ? URL_0 I 'm baffled . Please explain like I'm five.<>I would imagine it 's a combination of factors here . The snail is moving really slowly , reducing friction with the blade . At the same time , it is distributing it 's weight load aroun the blade as it moves over it , so as not to exert much pressure on the contact point . I 'm not familiar with a snails mode of locomotion , but since it does n't have legs I 'm assuming it moves similar to a snake , insulating different parts of its underbody in sync to create motion . It may not even really touch the fine point of the blade at all , if it can extend itself over , then use the extended part of its body to pull the rear over . Not a scientist , just a guy who likes neat questions .<>Snails are able to crawl over sharp objects like razors because they have a special type of slime that they secrete from their bodies. This slime acts like a sort of cushion that helps protect the snail's body as it moves. The slime also helps the snail to stick to surfaces, which makes it easier for the snail to crawl up and over things. So even though the snail is crawling over a sharp object, the slime helps to protect the snail's body and keeps it from getting cut open.<>reddit_eli5
