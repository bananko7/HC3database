Can GoogleFinance access total return data?<>At this time, Google Finance doesn't support historical return or dividend data, only share prices.  The attributes for mutual funds such as return52 are only available as real-time data, not historical.   Yahoo also does not appear to offer market return data including dividends. For example, the S&P 500 index does not account for dividends--the S&P ^SPXTR index does, but is unavailable through Yahoo Finance.<>GoogleFinance is a function in Google Sheets that allows you to retrieve current or historical financial data for a particular security or market index. It provides access to various financial data such as stock prices, dividends, and splits, but it does not provide access to total return data.Total return is a measure of the performance of an investment that takes into account both the capital gain or loss on the investment and any income or dividends received. To calculate total return, you would need to add the capital gain or loss to any dividends received, and then divide the result by the initial investment.There are a number of websites and tools that provide access to total return data for various securities and market indexes. Some examples include Morningstar, Yahoo Finance, and Bloomberg. You may be able to use these resources to obtain total return data for a particular security or market index.<>finance
