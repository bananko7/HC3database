How does 50 % sodium salt exist ? As sodium is a fundamental ingredient to the molecular structure of salt with a 1:1 relationship , how does Morton or other salt companies create the same amount of salt but with something like 50 % less sodium ? Explain like I'm five. <>They displace sodium chloride with potassium chloride . It does nâ€™t taste exactly the same , which is why light salt tastes a bit strange . Source : URL_0<>Salt is made up of two elements: sodium and chlorine. Sodium is a metal and chlorine is a gas. When they are combined, they form a compound called sodium chloride, which is what we commonly call salt. The chemical formula for salt is NaCl, which stands for sodium chloride.\\n\\nSalt companies, like Morton, can make salt with less sodium by using a process called \"dilution.\" This means that they add other ingredients to the salt to reduce the amount of sodium in the final product. For example, they might add a substance called potassium chloride, which is a compound that is similar to salt but has less sodium and more potassium. Potassium is a mineral that is important for our bodies to function properly.\\n\\nBy adding potassium chloride to the salt, Morton is able to create a product that has less sodium but still has the same salty taste. This is helpful for people who need to watch their sodium intake because they have high blood pressure or other health conditions.\\n\\nI hope this helps to explain how 50% sodium salt can exist! Let me know if you have any more questions.\\n<>reddit_eli5
