Are personal finance \/ money management classes taught in high school, anywhere?<>We had a \"civics\" class when I was a freshman in high school. This was in the Ann Arbor, MI public schools. It covered the very basics (how to balance your checkbook, what are stocks, how do income taxes work, what is interest, etc.) of money management along with an overview of politics and the legal system. It was a really light class, though, and didn't go deeply into personal finance and money management. I agree that such a class would be very valuable, as would cooking, nutrition, and basic home and car repair.<>Yes, some high schools offer personal finance or money management classes as part of their curriculum. These classes may be elective courses or required classes that all students must take in order to graduate. Personal finance classes may cover topics such as budgeting, saving, investing, credit and debt management, and financial planning. The specific content and format of the classes may vary depending on the school and the instructor. Some schools may offer these classes as part of a broader business or economics curriculum, while others may offer them as standalone courses. It's worth noting that the availability and type of personal finance education in schools can vary widely depending on the location and individual school. Some schools may have more comprehensive programs in place, while others may not offer any personal finance education at all.<>finance
