What is in the extra chromosome inside people with down syndrome ? Is it just junk DNA or a special type we do n't understand ? Please explain like I'm five.<>It 's just an extra copy of chromosome 21 . It 's not different than normal . Although sometimes it is only part of the chromosome 21 that 's attached to another chromosome .<>Down syndrome is a genetic condition that occurs when a person has an extra copy of a chromosome, specifically chromosome 21. This extra copy of the chromosome can cause physical and developmental differences in a person with Down syndrome.Chromosomes are structures inside cells that contain genes, which are instructions for the body's development and function. Genes are made up of DNA, which is a chemical that carries the instructions for how the body should grow and work.The extra chromosome in people with Down syndrome contains a mix of genes and DNA, just like any other chromosome. Some of the genes and DNA on the extra chromosome may be involved in the physical and developmental differences seen in people with Down syndrome, while other parts of the chromosome may be similar to those found in people without Down syndrome. Scientists are still learning about the specific genes and DNA on the extra chromosome and how they may contribute to the characteristics of Down syndrome.Overall, having an extra copy of a chromosome can affect how a person's body and brain develop and function. While there is still much to learn about Down syndrome, scientists and medical professionals are working to better understand the condition and to develop treatments and support to help people with Down syndrome lead healthy and fulfilling lives.<>reddit_eli5
