URL_0 DDoS issues I 've seen a few times in the past issues on what in regards to DDoS issues and have no idea what to make of it . I 've tried reading through but my vocabulary does n't go that high . Any help ? Thanks ! Please explain like I'm five.<>Picture the operator \/ secretary at a business . There 's a specific option in the phone tree for \" Office hours . \" People call up and ask if the business is open . The operator sees that specific phone line ring , picks up , says , \" Yes , we 're open . \" and hangs up . Normally , this happens a couple of times an hour . It 's an important call . The operator has to answer it . Now , get 10,000 people to all call the company over and over again . > \" Are you open ? \" - \" Yes . \" > \" Are you open ? \" - \" Yes \" > \" Are you open ? \" - \" Yes \" > \" Are you open ? \" - \" Yes \" > \" Are you open ? \" - \" Yes \" Soon , the operator is doing nothing else but answering the \" Are you open ? \" phone . Other people are trying to call . They have important business , but no one can get through because the \" Are you open ? \" line wo n't stop ringing . Same thing with websites . PING requests are simply one computer 's way of saying , \" Hey , I 'm trying this address . Is there anyone there ? \" and waiting for a reply . If you spam the server with enough PING requests , it overloads .<>A DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack is a type of cyberattack where the attacker tries to make a website or online service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. Imagine a group of people trying to get into a concert at the same time through a single door. The door is the website or online service, and the people are the traffic. If there are too many people trying to get through the door at the same time, it becomes very difficult for anyone to get in. The same thing happens to a website or online service during a DDoS attack. The traffic coming in becomes so much that the website or online service can't handle it and becomes slow or unavailable.<>reddit_eli5
