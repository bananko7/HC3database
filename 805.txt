Why are there more trained dogs than cats ? I 've seen cats that are trained , so I know that it is possible , but why is there such an imbalance ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Cats are solitary animals by nature . Sure , a domesticated cat will hang out with a person , but that 's really because the person has taken the place of its mother and pretty much arrested the social development of the cat somewhat into the true solitary assholes that their nature makes them . Dogs , on the other hand , are pack animals , and they love to please the pack leaders , which makes them much easier to train . So , in short , you can train a dog because it wants to make you happy . You can only train a cat if it wants to be trained .<>There are many possible reasons why there might seem to be more trained dogs than cats. One reason could be that dogs have been domesticated for much longer than cats, and have been bred to be more receptive to training. Dogs are also typically larger than cats, which may make them more suitable for certain types of work or training. It's also worth noting that cats and dogs are different species, and they may have different natural inclinations and abilities when it comes to learning and responding to training. Finally, it's possible that the popularity of certain dog breeds and the cultural perception of dogs as \"man's best friend\" may contribute to the perception that there are more trained dogs than cats.<>reddit_eli5
