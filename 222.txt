$ 29 trillion was spent during the bank bailouts [ 1 ] and the US debt is ~$17 trillion [ 2 ] why did n't we just pay of the public debt instead ? [ 1 ] URL_0 [ 2 ] URL_1 Explain like I'm five.<>Because eliminating the national debt would n't have prevented the banks from failing and it would n't have prevented a massive depression when the entire economy collapsed around our ears .<>The money that was used to bail out the banks during the financial crisis was not used to pay off the public debt, which is money that the government owes to its creditors. Instead, the money was used to try to stabilize the financial system and prevent the crisis from getting worse.\n\nImagine that you have a friend who is in financial trouble and can't pay their bills. You might lend them some money to help them out and get through a tough time. This is similar to what the government did when it bailed out the banks. The government gave the banks money to help them stay afloat and avoid going bankrupt.\n\nPaying off the public debt, on the other hand, is like paying back the money you borrowed from a bank or other lender. The government owes a lot of money to different creditors, and it has to pay them back over time, just like you would have to pay back a loan.\n\nSo, while it might seem like it would have been a good idea to use the money from the bank bailouts to pay off the public debt, that money was actually used for a different purpose.<>reddit_eli5
