How can AMD lose money year after year , yet still be in business ? AMD claims to lose money almost every quarter , and basically every single year . Here 's another quarter , and another loss : URL_0 how are they still in business ? Please explain like I'm five.<>I have a long running hypothesis . AMD is secretly owned by Intel to prevent antitrust legal action for being a monopoly . They never make money , are always one step behind and never go out of business .<>It's important to note that a company can still be successful and have a positive impact on the economy, even if it experiences losses in some quarters or years. There are a few reasons why a company like AMD might continue to operate despite reporting losses: \n1. The company may have a strong financial foundation: AMD may have a large cash reserve or access to credit that allows it to continue operating despite experiencing losses. \n2. The company may be investing in growth: Sometimes a company will report losses because it is investing in new products, technologies, or markets that it expects will generate profits in the future. This can be seen as a long-term investment in the company's growth and success. \n3. The company may be facing short-term challenges: A company might experience losses due to temporary issues, such as increased competition, changes in market conditions, or supply chain disruptions. These challenges can be addressed over time, and the company may return to profitability once they are resolved. \nIt's also worth noting that not all types of losses are created equal. For example, some losses may be due to one-time expenses, such as legal settlements or restructuring costs, while others may be ongoing operational expenses. This can affect how a company's losses are perceived and whether they are seen as a long-term concern or a temporary issue.<>reddit_eli5
