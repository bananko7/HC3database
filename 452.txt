Why is it that on Reddit practically everyone knows correct grammar while other parts of the Internet do n't know any at all ? Also , why does there seem to be an increase in English proficiency between barely passing seniors going into adulthood ? Explain like I'm five. <>I want to believe it 's because we consider ourselves the most literate of all social media . We write it , so that you can say that you were entertained having \" read it \" . We are also not limited to a mere 140 characters , thus reducing the possibility of a misunderstanding ( and consequently nuclear annihilation ) . When you do n't need to purposefully shorten words for the sake of space , you are given more freedom to concisely say with your own style what you want to by providing quality information that literate readers might appreciate . To say \" I am laughing out loud \" is to put a pox on all of the houses of social media who use lol as their standard form of showing how funny someone thinks a post is . Reddit is also where we can end a long - winded post that people may be too pressed for time to get to the end of , by putting in a TL;DR to sum it all up . * * TL;DR :* * Reddit has more class than all other forms of social media .<>On Reddit, there is a community of people who are interested in using correct grammar and spelling. They may be more likely to pay attention to these things and try to use them correctly because they are part of a community that values good language use.\\n\\nThere may be other parts of the internet where people do not use as much correct grammar and spelling because they are not as concerned with these things, or because they are communicating with people who do not care as much about these things.\\n\\nAs for the increase in English proficiency between seniors in high school and adults, this may be because as people get older and have more life experience, they have more opportunities to learn and improve their skills in various areas, including language. They may also have more motivation to use correct grammar and spelling because they are interacting with more people in professional or educational settings where good language use is important.<>reddit_eli5
