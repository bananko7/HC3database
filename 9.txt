Why is FIFA considered corrupt ? Just wondered since everyone that follows football knows that FIFA is a corrupt organization . Please explain like I'm five.
They accept bribes to change the location of the world cup . there probably is more but I know that is the case .
FIFA, which stands for the Fédération Internationale de Football Association, is the international governing body for soccer, also known as football. It is responsible for organizing and promoting international soccer tournaments, such as the World Cup. There have been allegations of corruption within FIFA for many years. Some people believe that FIFA is corrupt because there have been instances of bribery and fraud involving FIFA officials. For example, in 2015, several high-ranking FIFA officials were arrested and charged with corruption. They were accused of accepting bribes in exchange for awarding contracts for soccer tournaments and other events. It's important to note that not everyone who works for FIFA is corrupt, and there have been efforts to improve the organization's transparency and accountability. However, the allegations of corruption have damaged FIFA's reputation and led many people to view it as a corrupt organization.
