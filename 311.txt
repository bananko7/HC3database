Received a late 1099 MISC for income I reported already, do I have to amend?<>Why would the IRS be coming after you if you reported the income? If you reported everything, then the IRS will use the 1099 to cross-check, see that everything is in order, be happy and done with it. The lady was supposed to give you the 1099 by the end of January, and she may be penalized by the IRS for being late, but as long as you\/wifey reported all the income - you're fine. It was supposed to be reported on Schedule C or as miscellaneous income on line 21 (schedule C sounds more suitable as it seems that your wifey is in a cleaning business). But there's no difference in how you report whether you got 1099 or not, so if you reported - you should be fine.<>If you received a 1099-MISC form reporting income that you have already reported on your tax return, you do not need to file an amended tax return (Form 1040-X). The information on the 1099-MISC should match the information you reported on your tax return.However, if the 1099-MISC reports income that you did not include on your tax return, you will need to file an amended tax return to report this additional income. You should also file an amended tax return if you made a mistake on your original tax return, such as claiming the wrong deductions or credits.To amend your tax return, you will need to complete and file Form 1040-X. This form is used to make corrections to your tax return. Be sure to provide a detailed explanation of the changes you are making and the reasons for them. You should also attach any supporting documentation, such as the 1099-MISC form, to your amended tax return.It's important to note that you can only amend a tax return within three years of the date you filed the original return or within two years of the date you paid the tax, whichever is later. If you are outside of this time frame, you cannot file an amended tax return.<>finance
