Why do fruit and other sweet things taste so bad after brushing your teeth ? Why is it when after you brush your teeth and have a fruit or something fruit flavored or sweet does it taste so bad ? Explain like I'm five.<>There is a chemical in tooth paste which has the side effect of temporarily deactivating the sweet receptors on your tongue . URL_0<>When you brush your teeth, you use toothpaste that contains a chemical called fluoride. Fluoride helps to kill bacteria in your mouth and can also help to strengthen your teeth.\r\n\r\nThe taste buds on your tongue are responsible for detecting different flavors in the things you eat and drink. Different flavors are detected by different cells on your tongue, and some cells are more sensitive to certain flavors than others.\r\n\r\nAfter you brush your teeth, the fluoride in the toothpaste can change the way your taste buds work. It can make them less sensitive to sweet flavors, which is why fruit and other sweet things might taste less good to you. The fluoride can also change the way your tongue perceives other flavors, which is why things might taste a little different to you after brushing your teeth.\r\n\r\nIt's important to brush your teeth to help keep them clean and healthy, but it's also important to remember to rinse your mouth well after brushing to get rid of any remaining toothpaste. This can help your taste buds return to their normal sensitivity and allow you to enjoy the flavors of your food and drinks again.<>reddit_eli5
