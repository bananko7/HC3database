How do contracts work ? How can someone hold you responsible or even prove that you signed it ? Ca n't I just say that I did n't sign the contract or provide a phony signature ? AHHHHHH what the hell Please explain like I'm five.<>This is the very reason many contracts have to be notarized and\/or witnessed .<>A contract is a legally binding agreement between two or more parties. It sets out the terms and conditions that the parties have agreed upon in order to accomplish a specific purpose. In order for a contract to be enforceable, it must contain certain elements, such as an offer, acceptance, and consideration (something of value that is exchanged). One way to hold someone responsible for a contract is by proving that they signed it. This can be done through the use of a witness who saw the person signing the contract, or by using physical evidence such as a handwritten signature or an electronic signature. If you deny signing a contract or provide a phony signature, it may be difficult to enforce the contract. However, if the other party has strong evidence that you did, in fact, sign the contract (such as a witness or physical evidence), it may be possible for them to take legal action to enforce the contract. In summary, a contract is a legally binding agreement that sets out the terms and conditions of a specific purpose. It can be enforced by proving that the person agreed to the terms and conditions by signing the contract. If someone denies signing the contract or provides a phony signature, it may be difficult to enforce the contract.<>reddit_eli5
