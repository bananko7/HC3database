Is this subreddit a reference to the scene from The Office ? [ This one ] ( URL_0 ) Explain like I'm five.<>I believe it is . If I remember correctly , that link used to be somewhere in the sidebar . Initially , this sub actually answered every question with examples that a five year old would understand , just like Oscar did with Micheal . However , the structure of this sub has changed as it grew larger . Now , most of the questions are answered in adult language , but simplified . EDIT : The link is still in the sidebar<>Yes, the subreddit you mentioned is a reference to a scene from the popular TV show \"The Office.\" In the scene, a character named Dwight Schrute is participating in a \"Survivor\"-style competition with his coworkers. As part of the competition, Dwight is required to build a shelter using only the materials provided to him. He uses various office supplies, such as staplers and scissors, to build the shelter.\n\nIn the subreddit you mentioned, people post pictures and videos of creative and unusual shelters that they have built or come across, just like Dwight did in the show. The subreddit is a place for people to share and discuss these shelters, and to get ideas for building their own.<>reddit_eli5
