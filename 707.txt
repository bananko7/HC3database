Please explain what is \"Restricted Boltzmann machine\"<>A restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is a generative stochastic artificial neural network that can learn a probability distribution over its set of inputs.\nRBMs were initially invented under the name Harmonium by Paul Smolensky in 1986,\nand rose to prominence after Geoffrey Hinton and collaborators invented fast learning algorithms for them in the mid-2000. RBMs have found applications in dimensionality reduction,\nclassification,\ncollaborative filtering, feature learning,\ntopic modelling\nand even many body quantum mechanics. They can be trained in either supervised or unsupervised ways, depending on the task.\nAs their name implies, RBMs are a variant of Boltzmann machines, with the restriction that their neurons must form a bipartite graph: \na pair of nodes from each of the two groups of units (commonly referred to as the \"visible\" and \"hidden\" units respectively) may have a symmetric connection between them; and there are no connections between nodes within a group. By contrast, \"unrestricted\" Boltzmann machines may have connections between hidden units. This restriction allows for more efficient training algorithms than are available for the general class of Boltzmann machines, in particular the gradient-based contrastive divergence algorithm.\nRestricted Boltzmann machines can also be used in deep learning networks. In particular, deep belief networks can be formed by \"stacking\" RBMs and optionally fine-tuning the resulting deep network with gradient descent and backpropagation.[10]<>A Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is a type of neural network that can learn a probability distribution over a set of inputs. RBMs are generative models, meaning that they can generate new data samples that are similar to a training set. They are particularly useful for dimensionality reduction, feature learning, and collaborative filtering.\n\n\n\nAn RBM consists of visible units, which represent the input data, and hidden units, which capture the underlying structure of the data. The connections between the visible and hidden units are called weights, and there are no connections between the hidden units or between the visible units. The hidden units are used to extract features from the input data, and the visible units are used to reconstruct the input data from these features.\n\n\n\nRBMs can be trained using an algorithm called contrastive divergence, which involves making small updates to the weights of the network based on the difference between the input data and the reconstructed data. The goal of training is to minimize this difference, so that the RBM can accurately reconstruct the input data.\n\n\n\nRBMs have been used in a variety of applications, including image recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems. They have also been used as building blocks for more complex deep learning models, such as Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).<>wiki_csai
