Others might create viruses for the challenge of it, or to show off their technical skills. Some people might also create viruses as a way of making money, either by selling the virus to others or by using the virus to steal sensitive information from infected computers.\n\nIt's important to note that creating and spreading viruses is generally considered a bad thing, because it can cause a lot of harm and inconvenience to others.
