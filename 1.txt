How do artificial flavourings work ? Do you mix a bunch of chemicals and end up with a strawberry tasting substance , is it just a process of concentrating the original food , or something else completely ? Explain like I'm five. <>Nature produces some compounds that we find particularly tasty . We 're able to identify the structure of some of those compounds , and some of them are also pretty easy to synthesize , so we do .<>Artificial flavorings are made by mixing different chemicals together to create a substance that tastes like a particular food or drink. These chemicals are often derived from natural sources, such as plants and spices, but they can also be made in a laboratory.\\n\\nTo create a strawberry-flavored substance, for example, a flavorist (a scientist who specializes in creating flavors) might mix together chemicals that have a fruity taste, a sweet taste, and a slightly tart or sour taste. These chemicals are combined in specific amounts to try to replicate the taste of a real strawberry as closely as possible.\\n\\nThe process of creating artificial flavorings can be complex and requires a lot of knowledge and skill. Flavorists have to understand how different chemicals interact with each other and how they will be perceived by the human tongue. They also have to consider how the flavor will be used – for example, whether it will be added to a drink, a candy, or a baked good – and how it will be affected by other ingredients or by heat.\\n\\nOverall, the goal of artificial flavorings is to create a substance that tastes like a particular food or drink, without actually using the real thing. This can be useful in situations where the real food is not available or is too expensive, or when it is difficult to get the desired flavor using natural ingredients.<>Artificial flavorings are made by mixing different chemicals together to create a substance that tastes like a particular food or drink.
