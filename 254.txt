Why is our pee naturally yellow ? Edit : did n't think my pee questions would get me to the front page , thanks guys ! Explain like I'm five.<>The yellow color in urine is due to chemicals called urobilins [ Urobilins Wiki ] ( URL_0 ) . These are the breakdown products of the bile pigment bilirubin . Bilirubin is itself a breakdown product of the heme part of hemoglobin from worn - out red blood cells . Most bilirubin is partly broken down in the liver , stored in the gall bladder , broken down some more in the intestines , and excreted in the feces ( its metabolites are what make feces brown ) , but some remains in the bloodstream to be extracted by the kidneys where , converted to urobilins , it gives urine that familiar yellow tint . [ Here is a super , diagram example of how this works , Not ELI5 ; more like ELI Am Heisenberg for you Chemistry buffs ] ( URL_1 ) These same yellow chemicals also cause the yellow color of jaundice and of bruises , both of which result when more hemoglobin than usual is being broken down and\/or the processing of its breakdown products by the liver is not able to keep up . Lastly , when we drink lots of fluids , we ~~saturate~~ dilute our pee which makes it less yellow . When we are dehydrated , you get this stinking , brown pee that is no good in your body . * * Edit * * Grammar<>Urine is naturally yellow because it contains a pigment called urochrome. Urochrome is produced when the liver breaks down a substance called bilirubin, which is produced when red blood cells are broken down and replaced with new ones. The liver helps filter bilirubin out of the blood and sends it to the bile ducts, which carry it to the small intestine. Urochrome is then eliminated from the body in the urine.\r\n\r\nWhen you drink fluids, your body absorbs what it needs and gets rid of the rest through the kidneys and urinary system. The kidneys filter the blood and remove waste products, such as urochrome, which then pass out of the body in the form of urine. So, the yellow color of your urine is a result of this process of eliminating waste products from your body.\r\n\r\nIt's normal for urine to be a pale yellow color, but the shade can vary depending on how much fluid you have in your body and what you have been eating or drinking. For example, if you are dehydrated and not drinking enough fluids, your urine may be a darker yellow color because there is less liquid to dilute the urochrome. Similarly, if you are drinking a lot of fluids, your urine may be a lighter yellow color. Some foods and medications can also affect the color of your urine. For example, eating beets can make your urine appear pink or red, and taking certain medications can make it appear orange or blue.<>reddit_eli5
