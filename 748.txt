How do cops prove you ’ve been over the speed limit ? Do they always need conclusive proof to write you a ticket ? Sorry in advance for all the follow up questions , I ’m just a curious 16 year old . Explain like I'm five. <>in most jurisdictions , the officer is regarded as the expert . which realistically means the officer can say \" he was speeding \" and that 's considered proof by the court .<>There are several ways that police officers can prove that you were speeding. Here are a few common methods:\\n\\nRadar guns: These devices use radio waves to measure the speed of a vehicle. An officer can aim the radar gun at a passing car and get an instant reading of its speed.\\n\\nLaser guns: These devices use a beam of light to measure the speed of a vehicle. They work in a similar way to radar guns, but use a laser instead of radio waves.\\n\\nPace timing: This is when an officer follows a car for a certain distance and time, and then compares the time it took to travel that distance with the posted speed limit.\\n\\nAircraft: In some cases, police officers may use aircraft to monitor the speed of vehicles on the ground.\\n\\nIn order to write you a ticket, the officer needs to have reasonable suspicion that you were speeding. This means that they must have some evidence to support their belief that you were breaking the speed limit. However, they do not necessarily need conclusive proof in order to write you a ticket. If you believe that you were wrongly ticketed, you may have the option to challenge the ticket in court and present your own evidence to support your case.<>reddit_eli5
