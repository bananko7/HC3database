Why does the the human mind ignore the second \" the \" ? EDIT : Thanks for the the gold ! Please explain like I'm five.<>There 's a phenomenon called [ attentional blink ] ( URL_0 ) where , when you 're rapidly presented with stimuli , your brain will perceive two identical stimuli in a row as a single stimulus . Basically , your brain sees \" the the \" and assumes there was only one . In nature , identical stimuli in rapid succession are vanishingly rare - if you see two crouching tigers from the same angle and in the same position in a quarter of a second , it 's much more likely there was only one tiger and you just blinked ; so your brain edits your perceptions with that in mind .<>The human mind is able to quickly process and understand language, and it does this by ignoring certain words that are not necessary for understanding the meaning of a sentence. In the case of the second \"the\" in the phrase \"the the,\" it is not necessary for understanding the meaning of the sentence, so the mind tends to ignore it.Think of it like this: when you are reading or listening to a sentence, your mind is trying to figure out what the person is trying to say. It does this by picking out the most important words and using them to understand the meaning of the sentence. The second \"the\" in \"the the\" is not an important word, so the mind just skips over it and focuses on the other words in the sentence.In general, it is important to use clear and concise language when communicating, and using unnecessary words like the second \"the\" in \"the the\" can make it harder for the listener or reader to understand what you are trying to say.<>reddit_eli5
