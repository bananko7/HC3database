Why ca n't shows like Mythbusters show brands in their TV shows ? They always put tape over it or cover it in some other way , I 've seen this done in a lot of other shows as well ( DigitalRev ) Explain like I'm five.<>The presence of one brand may piss off one of their advertisers , who may produce a competing brand of the same product . i.e. They are seen using a Coca - Cola product and now Pepsico refuses to advertise on a show that promotes their competition .<>There are a few reasons why TV shows like Mythbusters might cover or obscure the brand names of products that appear on the show.\r\n\r\nOne reason is that the show might not have permission from the brand to show their products on TV. In order to use a brand's product on a TV show or in a movie, the producers often need to get permission from the company that makes the product. This is called \"product placement.\" If the show doesn't have permission to use the product, they might cover up the brand name so that they don't advertise the product without permission.\r\n\r\nAnother reason is that the show might not want to appear to be endorsing a particular brand or product. By covering up the brand name, the show can avoid giving the impression that they are promoting a particular product over others.\r\n\r\nFinally, some shows might cover up brand names simply to keep the focus on the content of the show rather than on the products that appear in it. This can help the viewers stay engaged with the story or the experiments being shown, rather than getting distracted by the brands of the products being used.<>There are a few reasons why TV shows like Mythbusters might cover or obscure the brand names of products that appear on the show.\r\n\r\nOne reason is that the show might not have permission from the brand to show their products on TV.
