Why are some people into \" prepping \" ? It does n't seem like the government is about to fall any time soon . Seems like an apocalyptic cult promising an end that never comes . Please explain like I'm five.<>Some people have genuine reasons for \" prepping \" ( e.g. they 've had relatives in areas where hurricanes have hit and seen how little outside help was provided to these people \/ they live on fault lines where there is a high chance of an earthquake taking out the power grid \/ they live in an issolated area ) whereas others are basically deranged conspiracy theorists and then there are others that simply do it as a hobby that allows them to meet up with new people and learn some valuable skills ( e.g. first aid \/ hunting etc ) .<>Prepping, also known as \"survivalism,\" refers to the practice of preparing for emergencies or disasters. Some people are into prepping because they believe it is important to be self-sufficient and able to take care of themselves and their loved ones in the event of a crisis. This could be a natural disaster, such as a hurricane or earthquake, or a man-made disaster, such as a financial collapse or cyber attack. \nPeople who are into prepping often stockpile supplies, such as food, water, and medical supplies, and may also learn skills like first aid or how to start a fire without matches. They may also have backup plans in place, such as a safe place to go or a way to communicate with others if regular means of communication are disrupted. \nWhile it is true that the government is not likely to collapse anytime soon, disasters and emergencies can happen at any time and being prepared can help people cope with the challenges they may face. It is important to note that prepping does not necessarily mean expecting the worst to happen, but rather being prepared for a range of possible outcomes.<>reddit_eli5
