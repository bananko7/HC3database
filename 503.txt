Will a Barclaycard Visa help me in building up credit score?<>Payment history is probably the most significant contributor to your credit score.  Having a solid history of making, at least the minimum, payments on time will have a positive impact on your credit score.  Whether or not this specific transaction means anything to that equation is up for debate.   If you have no credit lines now and 0% for 18 months on a computer makes sense to you, then yes, making this purchase this way and paying on time will have a positive impact on your credit score.  Paying interest doesn't help your credit score.  Repay this computer before the 18 month period ends, then be sure to pay your balance in full every month thereafter.<>Yes, using a Barclaycard Visa or any other credit card responsibly can help you build up your credit score. When you use a credit card, the card issuer reports your payment history and credit utilization (the amount of credit you're using compared to your credit limit) to the credit bureaus, which then use this information to calculate your credit score.To build up your credit score with a Barclaycard Visa or any other credit card, it's important to make sure you make your payments on time and keep your credit utilization low. This means using your credit card responsibly, such as only charging what you can afford to pay off in full each month and keeping your balances low.It's also a good idea to diversify your credit sources, which means having a mix of different types of credit accounts, such as a mortgage, a car loan, and a credit card. This can help improve your credit score because it shows that you can manage different types of credit responsibly.Overall, using a Barclaycard Visa or any other credit card responsibly can help you build up your credit score over time, but it's important to use your credit wisely and make sure you understand the terms and conditions of your credit card agreement.<>finance
