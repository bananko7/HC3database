how does jamming a hollow object through a person with a punctured lung save their lives ? Was watching a scene from Walking Dead and this came to mind . Please explain like I'm five.<>It doens't work that way in real life . You are a pressure vessel . If the lung gets punctured the air \/ blood leaks into the chest cavity causing pressure on the other lung and heart and other organs . By inserting a tube you are releasing the pressure<>In the context of the TV show \"The Walking Dead,\" it is not accurate to say that jamming a hollow object through a person with a punctured lung would save their lives. In real life, a punctured lung, also known as a pneumothorax, is a serious medical condition that occurs when air escapes from the lung and builds up in the space between the lung and the chest wall. This can cause the lung to collapse and make it difficult for the person to breathe. \nTo treat a punctured lung, a doctor would typically use a needle or small tube to remove the excess air from the chest cavity. This can help to re-expand the collapsed lung and allow the person to breathe more easily. In some cases, a larger tube may be inserted through a small incision in the chest to keep the lung expanded until it can heal. \nIt is important to seek medical treatment as soon as possible if you or someone you know has a punctured lung. Prompt treatment can help to prevent further complications and improve the chances of a full recovery.<>reddit_eli5
