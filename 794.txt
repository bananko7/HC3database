What are the importance of Memoirs ? I see in my English class that Memoirs are really important , why is that ? Please explain like I'm five.<>They provide a firsthand account of events . A seeing of events through the written words of another being . However , like a courtroom witness ; credibility , personal effects , and knowledge of subject matter should be taken into account .<>Memoirs are important because they allow people to share their personal experiences and memories with others. They can be a way for people to reflect on their lives and think about the things that have happened to them. They can also be a way for people to understand and learn about other people's lives and experiences, which can help us to better understand and empathize with others. Memoirs can be inspiring, educational, and entertaining, and they can help us to see the world from a different perspective.<>reddit_eli5
