Explain like I'm five.<>It 's a cultural difference . I 'm not a historian , so I ca n't tell you how it began , but I can tell you what people eat for breakfast varies wildly across the world . Lots of people , Americans included , do not eat a sweet meal for breakfast . In some cultures it 's not at all common . Personally I do n't have much of a sweet tooth and do n't care for a sweet breakfast .<>Great question! The types of foods that we eat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner can vary depending on where you live and your personal preferences. But in general, there are some common patterns that people follow when it comes to eating different types of meals at different times of the day. For breakfast, people often eat foods that are high in carbohydrates, such as cereal, toast, or oatmeal. These types of foods can help give us energy to start our day. People also sometimes eat sweeter foods for breakfast, like pastries or fruit, because they can also provide a quick boost of energy. For lunch and dinner, people tend to eat more savory foods, like meat, poultry, or fish, along with vegetables and grains like rice or pasta. These types of foods can help provide the nutrients and energy that our bodies need to function throughout the day. Overall, the types of foods that we eat for different meals are largely a matter of tradition and personal preference, but they can also be influenced by the nutritional needs of our bodies at different times of the day.<>reddit_eli5
