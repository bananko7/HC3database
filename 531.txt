The intent is to cause fear that is felt across a large group of people that were not necessarily directly affected by the violent action .<>Sure! A hate crime is a crime that is motivated by the offender's bias or prejudice against a particular group of people. This can include crimes based on someone's race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability. Hate crimes can take many forms, such as physical violence, vandalism, or threatening language or behavior.Terrorism is the use of violence or threats of violence to achieve a political, religious, or ideological goal. It is often intended to spread fear and intimidate a larger group of people, beyond the immediate victims of the violence. Terrorism can involve attacks on civilians, government buildings or officials, or infrastructure, and can be carried out by individuals or groups.Both hate crimes and terrorism can cause harm and fear in communities, but they differ in the specific motivations and goals of the perpetrators. Hate crimes are motivated by bias or prejudice against a particular group, while terrorism is motivated by a desire to achieve a political or ideological goal through violence or threats of violence.<>reddit_eli5
