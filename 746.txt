Why does it take so long for a movie to come out on DVD after leaving theaters ? Is it just the whole process of converting it to the DVD format ? Who does that anyways ? Is it the movie studio or a third party ? Explain like I'm five.<>There is a big commercial reason . Take The Dark Knight Rises . It was released on July 20th . Why that date ? Easy , because it 's summer , schools out , people are on vacation , and have more free time . Most big - blockbuster films come out around the summertime . So , the movie is released , makes a ton of money , and eventually leaves the theatres and dies out . They wait months for several reasons : so people * have * to see the film as the only viewing option . Then , to capitalize on the shopping holidays ( Christmas ) , the film is released on DVD and Blu - Ray . Everyone who saw it either buys a copy or gets it for their kids . Basically , it is to maximize potential profits .<>There are a few reasons why it can take a while for a movie to come out on DVD after it leaves theaters. One reason is that the movie studio wants to make sure that as many people as possible see the movie in theaters first, because this is typically where they make the most money.\n\nAnother reason is that it takes time to convert the movie into the format that is used for DVDs and Blu-ray discs. This process is called \"mastering,\" and it involves transferring the movie from the original film or digital format to a format that can be used for home video. This process can be time-consuming, especially if the movie is long or has a lot of special effects.\n\nWho does this process depends on the movie studio. Some studios have their own in-house teams that handle the mastering process, while others outsource it to third-party companies. Either way, the goal is to make sure that the movie looks and sounds as good as possible on a home video format.\n\nI hope this helps! Is there anything else you would like to know?<>reddit_eli5
