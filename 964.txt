Why do my eyes water when I do a really satisfying wee ? Especially when I do my ' reconnecting with nature ' outside wees in the morning Please explain like I'm five.<>A great piss can beat an ejaculation in my honest opinion . You know that piss that you have been holding onto since breaking the piss seal 56 minutes earlier at the train station . And in that 56 minutes those last minute traveller beers have mutated into an agonising need to evacuate your bladder only exacerbated by the constant rocking of the carriage . When you arrive at your destination , a quick sprint is followed by a godly piss lasting what seems like hours , you can only breath a sigh of relief as this orgasmic piss escapes ... that s what I live for<>When you go to the bathroom to pee, your body is getting rid of excess liquid and waste that it doesn't need. Sometimes, when you are able to completely empty your bladder and feel relieved, your body may respond by producing tears as a reflex. This is because the muscles that control your tear ducts and the muscles that control your bladder are located near each other, and they can sometimes be triggered at the same time. This is a normal and healthy response that many people experience. It's not necessarily related to the fact that you are going to the bathroom outside or in the morning. It's just a reflex that your body has.<>reddit_eli5
