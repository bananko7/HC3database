Why is Buzzfeed ' click - bait ' ? What makes Buzzfeed click - bait ? I read some articles out of interest or boredom , but click - bait sounds sinister in some way . What does it mean and why is Buzzfeed hated for it ? Please explain like I'm five.
Their title are very intentionally created to raise questions without answering them in the hopes you 'll click . They also use now - cliched hooks like \" the answer will shock you ! \" Buzzfeed wants your clicks so they can make their money . Here 's a headline and short description pulled from the BBC : > * * Iraq swears in unity government * * Iraq swears in a new government with Sunni and Kurdish deputy prime ministers after weeks of deadlock , as the country struggles against Islamic State fighters . It tells you what you need to know concisely . If you want details you 're free to read the whole article , but what you 're going to get in that article is made perfectly clear by that little headline and short follow - up . Buzzfeed , on the other hand , raises more questions than it answers with a click - bait article headline . It 's anti - content . That said Buzzfeed is hardly alone in click - baiting ; plenty of news agencies have done it and do it today too . Even the BBC has made some dubious article headlines in the click - bait tradition . Also I hear people complaining about Buzzfeed being abject plagiarists and inane much more than about click - bait titles .
\"Clickbait\" refers to online content that is designed to entice people to click on a link, often by using sensational or misleading headlines or images. The goal of clickbait is typically to generate ad revenue or increase website traffic, rather than to provide informative or valuable content to the reader. Buzzfeed is often accused of using clickbait tactics because it creates content that is designed to be shared widely on social media platforms, and many of its headlines and images are designed to be attention-grabbing and sensational in order to encourage people to click on the link and read the article. Some people may find this type of content annoying or manipulative, and they may view Buzzfeed as a source of low-quality or superficial content. However, it's important to note that not all content on Buzzfeed is clickbait, and the website also produces serious journalism and informative articles. It's up to the reader to decide whether they want to click on a link and read an article, and to be aware of the potential for clickbait headlines and images when reading online content.
