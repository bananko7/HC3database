Why I should n't be alive ? ( I was born in 8th month ) Anyone I tell I was born in 8th month say that I should n't be alive ? But they do n't say that to 7th months born Sorry for my bad English Explain like I'm five.<>Instead of bashing your question like \/u \/ DreadPirateHenry , I 'll actually answer it . Lungs take the most time to develop . At 7 months your lung development is roughly on par with the rest of the body , and therefore it 's high function , after that though , the lung are still developing even though the rest of the body is n't , so the lungs are n't as high functioning and can cause respiratory problems at birth . But , like the pirate said , it 's not much of a problem any more because they can give the infant steroids to boost lung development . Back before this though , it was rare to see one survive . It 's also why 8 month babies that survive are said to be lucky .<>It's not true that you shouldn't be alive just because you were born in the 8th month. Every person is different, and some people are born earlier than others. Some babies are born healthy and strong even if they are born a little early. It's important to remember that every person is unique and special, no matter when they were born.<>It's not true that you shouldn't be alive just because you were born in the 8th month.
