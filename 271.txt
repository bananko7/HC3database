What is attorney - client privilege ? I googled it and I could n't really get a grasp on it . I need to know as soon as possible because it 's for my debate case . Thanks ! Explain like I'm five.<>Some good answers here ; I just wanted to add that this evidentiary privilege belongs to and is intended to benefit the * client . * So s \/ he decides whether or not to waive the privilege in a given case . An attorney can not disclose protected communication \/ information without the client 's consent , regardless of whether he thinks its in his client 's interest , whether he thinks his client 's actions are morally reprehensible , etc . The only time an attorney can breach confidentiality is if his client has told him that he is going to commit a crime or hurt someone . The dimensions of this exception are very nuanced , and vary from state to state . Also , attorney client privilege persists even * after * the attorney - client relationship has ended . It can also arise * before * the attorney - client relationship starts , if a prospective client tells something to an attorney in the course of trying to secure legal counsel .<>Attorney-client privilege is a legal concept that protects communications between a client and their lawyer. It means that if you talk to your lawyer about a legal problem or issue, what you say to them is private and cannot be shared with anyone else without your permission.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of how it works: Imagine you are in a legal dispute with someone and you go to see a lawyer for advice. You tell the lawyer all the details of the dispute and ask for their help. The lawyer then gives you advice on how to handle the situation. Because of attorney-client privilege, the lawyer cannot tell anyone else what you said to them or what advice they gave you. This is important because it allows you to speak openly and honestly with your lawyer, without worrying that your words will be used against you in court or elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSo, in short, attorney-client privilege is a way to protect your private conversations with your lawyer and make sure they stay private.<>reddit_eli5
