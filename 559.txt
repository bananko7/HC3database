Lightsaber Theoretically , are they or would they ever be possible ? Explain like I'm five.<>No . There would be no way to force it to just cut off at a given distance .<>Lightsabers are a fictional weapon in the Star Wars universe. They are a type of sword that is made up of a glowing blade of energy that can cut through almost anything.\n\nIn reality, it is not possible to create a lightsaber because it is based on science fiction and not real science. In order for a lightsaber to work, it would need to be able to produce a beam of energy that is hot enough to cut through solid objects, but it would also need to be contained within a handle that a person could hold without getting burned. This is not currently possible with our current understanding of science and technology.\n\nHowever, scientists and engineers are constantly working on new technologies and discovering new ways to do things that were once thought to be impossible. So while it is not currently possible to create a lightsaber, it is always possible that someday someone may figure out how to make one. But for now, lightsabers will have to remain in the world of science fiction.<>reddit_eli5
