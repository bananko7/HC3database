The market sets prices and the way JP Morgan or any other bank or organization determines the price it's willing to deal in would be proprietary business information.
Emini futures, also known as E-mini or Mini futures, are futures contracts that represent a smaller-sized version of a standard futures contract. Like any other futures contract, the price of an Emini futures contract is determined by supply and demand in the market, as well as the underlying spot price of the asset being traded, which is referred to as the \"underlying instrument.\"The underlying instrument for an Emini futures contract can be a wide range of assets, including stocks, commodities, currencies, and indexes. For example, the E-mini S&P 500 futures contract is based on the S&P 500 index, while the E-mini NASDAQ 100 futures contract is based on the NASDAQ 100 index.The price of an Emini futures contract is generally quoted in terms of the underlying instrument, with a tick size and tick value that are set by the exchange where the contract is traded. The tick size is the minimum price increment for the contract, while the tick value is the monetary value of each tick.For example, the E-mini S&P 500 futures contract is quoted in terms of the S&P 500 index, with a tick size of 0.25 points and a tick value of $12.50. This means that if the underlying S&P 500 index increases by 0.25 points, the price of the E-mini S&P 500 futures contract will increase by $12.50.The price of an Emini futures contract is also influenced by other factors, such as the level of interest rates, the overall demand for the underlying instrument, and the supply and demand for the futures contract itself.
