Are BIC and SWIFT code the same things?<>BIC and IBANN are used in EU (and some other OECD countries) for inter bank transfers. SWIFT is used everywhere for interbank transfers. In the US - IBAN system is not (yet, hopefully) available, so you have to use SWIFT. The codes may look the same, but these are different systems. More details here.<>BIC (Bank Identifier Code) and SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) code are similar, but they are not the same thing.A BIC is a unique code that identifies a specific bank. It is used to identify banks in financial transactions such as wire transfers, and is also known as a SWIFT code. The BIC is composed of 8 or 11 characters and is used to identify the bank and branch that an account is held at.SWIFT, on the other hand, is a global network that banks use to send and receive financial information. It is a secure messaging network that enables banks to send and receive information, such as payment instructions, electronically. The SWIFT network is used by banks and financial institutions around the world to exchange information about financial transactions.In summary, a BIC is a specific code that identifies a bank, while SWIFT is a network that is used by banks to exchange financial information.<>finance
