what 's the reasoning behind some parents not wanting to vaccinate their kids ? I know absolutely nothing about the subject , I just see the topic come up all the time on Reddit . Please explain like I'm five.<>There is no ( typical ) reason to . People site a dubious study that was never accepted by the scientific community and even recanted by the original researcher . Even then , the study suggested there might be a correlation between vaccination and autism . That in of itself is n't cause for the movement it has started . People also are scared of the big words like Ammonium sulfate , Formaldehyde , and Mercury which are part of vaccines . They are also siting the increase in autism diagnoses . Keyword : increase in diagnoses . This is caused by a lot of things such as the fact that we are more aware of the disorder ( and it 's symptoms ) and over diagnosing . This does not mean that autism is suddenly everywhere . It means we are more aware of what was already there . That being said , there * might * be something that is increasing autism rates , but we ca n't be sure of it one way or another . What we * can * be sure of is that it is n't vaccines . The things that * are * increasing are deaths and cases of * * very * * preventable diseases . Edit , found the video : Let 's assume that vaccines * do * cause autism . Well , Penn & Teller have a [ nice rebuttal ] ( URL_0 ) for that anyway ( there is loud cursing , so I would n't recommend watching that at work ) .<>There are a few reasons why some parents may not want to vaccinate their children. Some people may have concerns about the safety of vaccines or believe that they are not effective at preventing disease. Others may have religious or philosophical objections to vaccination. \nIt's important to understand that vaccines are very safe and have been proven to be effective at preventing serious and sometimes deadly diseases. Many of these diseases, such as measles and polio, are now rare in the United States because of vaccines. \nHowever, it's also important to respect the beliefs and decisions of others. If you have questions about vaccination, it's a good idea to talk to a trusted healthcare provider or do your own research to make an informed decision.<>reddit_eli5
