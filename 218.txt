What \" freedom of speech \" actually means In respect to the US government . Please do n't say , \" it means you can say whatever you want \" and if possible provide a source Please explain like I'm five.<>In terms of US law , freedom of speech just means that the government ca n't arrest you and throw you in jail because of what you say \/ write . There are , of course , limitations of freedom of speech . The ones that come to mind are : * \" Fighting words \" , which is speech that is designed to incite others to imminent violence . * Libel \/ slander , which is false speech ( lies ) that are intended to harm others in some way . * Speech that , by its nature , causes a threat of harm to others ( such as shouting \" Fire ! \" in a crowded theater when there is no fire , causing a stampede for the exit ) . * Credible threats to cause harm others ( assault ) . What freedom of speech * * does n't * * mean is that private citizens must provide you with a forum for speaking . So , for instance , private websites are free to delete your comments or otherwise censor you , just like you 're free to kick out a guest in your house who scribbles on your walls .<>Freedom of speech is the idea that people have the right to express their thoughts and ideas without fear of being punished by the government. This means that you can say what you want, write what you want, and publish what you want, as long as it is not harmful to others. For example, you can express your opinions about the government, criticize politicians, and even protest against things that you disagree with, as long as you are not inciting violence or causing harm to others. You can also express your thoughts and ideas through art, music, and other forms of expression. Freedom of speech is an important part of democracy and helps to ensure that people have the ability to share their ideas and hold those in power accountable. It is protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which states that \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\" This means that the government cannot make laws that restrict your ability to speak freely or express yourself. However, freedom of speech is not absolute and there are some limitations. For example, you cannot use speech to incite violence or harm others, or to make false statements that cause harm or damage to someone's reputation. I hope this helps to explain what freedom of speech means. If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to ask.<>reddit_eli5
