Why are the edges of some coins , such as the quarter , two different colors while the faces are the same color ? Like this URL_0 Explain like I'm five.<>Coins used to be made out of silver and gold that had value based on the metal in them . This is why they have the ' bumpy ' edges - so you could tell if somebody shaved them down . Somewhere along the line money became a representation of value , rather than actually being valuable itself ( something too complex to go into here - you can probably find a good ELI5 about \" fiat currency \" or departure from the \" gold standard \" if you search ) which meant we could make coins out of cheaper metals . The \" old \" quarter was mostly silver - a composition that is [ worth $ 5.50 today ] ( URL_0 ) . As you can imagine , making a $ 0.25 coin that could be melted down for several dollars worth of silver would be a bad idea , so they reformulated it to have a copper core with a nickel face ( nickel looks pretty much the same as silver but is far cheaper ) - a composition that 's only about $ 0.05 worth of metal . As for why you can see it on some coins and not others ... that 's just a \" it 's how they 're made \" . On a tangentially related note - pennies made after 1982 are 97 % zinc with a very thin copper coating . Zinc has one of the [ lowest melting temperatures of common metals ] ( URL_1 ) . You can easily melt one with a common butane jet lighter ( the ones with the bright blue flames ) - be careful if you do this , it 's still 800 degree hot melted metal that might do unpredictable things - you should have eye protection and a glass of water nearby to drop it into .<>The edges of some coins, like the quarter, are two different colors because the edges are made of a different metal than the faces of the coin. The faces of the quarter are made of copper-nickel, which is a shiny silver color. The edges of the quarter are made of a different metal called copper, which is a reddish-brown color.\n\nSometimes coins are made with different metals in different parts to make them stronger or more durable. The edges of the quarter are made of copper because it is a strong and durable metal that can help the coin last longer. The different colors on the coin help people to easily tell the front from the back and the top from the bottom.<>reddit_eli5
