If we can create animals like \" ligers \" and \" mules \" why have n't we attempted to create a mix of humans and chimps ? Through artificial insemination obviously , just to avoid any bestiality references Please explain like I'm five.<>Humans and chimps do n't have the right amount of chromosomes to create ( infertile ) offspring . Typically foreign sperm will be rejected , and even if it did make it to the egg there are cellular checkpoints that make sure things are on the up and up . When the egg cell starts dividing and the chromosomes do n't match up properly , everything gets shut down<>It's not possible to create a mix of humans and chimpanzees through artificial insemination or any other means. Humans and chimpanzees are separate species, and they are not able to reproduce with each other. Ligers and mules are created by breeding two different species of animals that are closely related and can produce offspring together. Humans and chimpanzees are not closely related and cannot produce offspring together. \nAdditionally, it would be unethical to try to create a hybrid of a human and a chimpanzee, as it would involve manipulating the reproductive systems of both species in a way that could cause harm or suffering. Humans and chimpanzees have their own unique qualities and should be respected as individual species.<>reddit_eli5
