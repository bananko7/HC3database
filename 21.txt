Why is snoring particularly annoying and hard to fall asleep within earshot of ? Is it a sound that is supposed to trigger something or alarm us ? Or is it just annoying ? Explain like I'm five. <>It 's generally not rhythmic . In order for background noise not to disrupt your sleep it needs to be melodic or rhythmic .<>Snoring can be annoying and hard to fall asleep near because it is a loud, repetitive sound that can disrupt the natural rhythm of breathing. When you sleep, your body naturally relaxes and your muscles, including those in your throat, become less tense. However, if the muscles in your throat become too relaxed, it can cause a partial blockage of your airway. This can cause the air you breathe in and out to make a loud, vibrating noise as it tries to pass through the narrow opening, which is what we call snoring. Snoring can be annoying because it can be loud and disrupt your sleep, but it is not a sound that is designed to trigger an alarm or warning.<>reddit_eli5
