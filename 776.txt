Would guns work on a Moon and in space , and why ? * the Moon Explain like I'm five.<>Gunpowder does not need air to explode . So yes , they will work . The gun feeding another bullet becomes iffy . A gun like a glock that works on the force of the slide and casing getting blown back would have no problem , most guns work like this . A gun like and AK 47 uses a little tube of gas coming from the barrel to cycle the next bullet . This type may not get enough pressure with the barrel being empty of all air when firing , but it could always be done manually .<>Guns would not work on the Moon in the same way that they do on Earth. This is because the Moon has no atmosphere, which means there is no air to allow the bullet to travel through. Without air, the bullet would not have any force behind it and would not be able to leave the barrel of the gun.\n\nIn addition to the lack of atmosphere, the Moon also has much weaker gravity than Earth. This means that the bullet would not have as much force when it is fired and would not travel as far or as fast as it would on Earth.\n\nOverall, guns would not be a practical or effective way to defend oneself or attack others on the Moon. There are many other challenges that people would face while living or working on the Moon, and using guns would not be a suitable solution to any of these challenges.<>reddit_eli5
