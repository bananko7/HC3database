Why do fancy restaurants give so little food ? With the amount they give per entree , I 'd have to eat 3 - 4 of them to be full . I 'm paying more and getting less food ? What gives ! Please explain like I'm five.<>A lot of fancy restaurants will offer plenty of courses , you 're expected to be there 2 hours , and over that time and a bunch of food courses you should be fairly satisfied . If you go and just order the last course of 4 oz filet mignon , you probably wo n't be satisfied . It 's more about the experience than filling you to the brim with fancy mac and cheese .<>Fancy restaurants often serve smaller portions than more casual dining establishments because the focus is often on the quality and presentation of the food, rather than the quantity. The dishes are often carefully crafted and prepared using high-quality ingredients, and may be presented in an artful or decorative way. This can make the dining experience more special and memorable. Additionally, fancy restaurants may offer a wider variety of dishes for guests to choose from, which allows them to sample a variety of flavors and culinary techniques. This can be a more enjoyable and satisfying way to dine, rather than just eating a large portion of one dish. It's also worth noting that the price of a meal at a fancy restaurant may include other factors beyond the food itself, such as the cost of the ingredients, the skill of the chefs and kitchen staff, the ambiance of the restaurant, and the level of service. All of these factors can contribute to the overall cost of the meal. In short, fancy restaurants often serve smaller portions because the focus is on the quality and presentation of the food, rather than the quantity. The price of the meal may also include other factors beyond the food itself.<>reddit_eli5
