Explain to me a green screen like I 'm 5 . I get that the image is projected on to the green screen , but why is the color green the most conducive of the colors and such ? Explain like I'm five.<>Ah , this technology is called chroma - keying . The image is n't projected at all . A person is filmed in front of a big green sheet ( or blue ) and when they look at it in person , all they see is green ( or blue ) . Then , in editing , an image is added in â€” basically the computer tells the video \" insert this image \/ video footage anywhere where it 's this shade of green . \" The reason it 's green or often blue is because skin wo n't get accidentally picked up . Skin hues , regardless of race , are generally red - based ( pinkish , so to speak ) but not very green or blue based , so you run little risk of the computer mistaking your skin for the background .

The screen is usually a bright green color, and it is used as a background for actors and actresses to perform in front of. The reason that the screen is green is because green is a color that is very different from most skin tones and hair colors. This makes it easy for the computer to \"key out\" the green color and replace it with a different background image. For example, if an actor is standing in front of a green screen and pretending to fly through the air, the computer can take the green screen out of the picture and put in a picture of the sky or a cityscape instead. So, the green screen is a very useful tool for creating special effects because it allows the computer to easily separate the actors and actresses from the background. This makes it easier to create all kinds of amazing and realistic scenes and effects that wouldn't be possible without it.<>reddit_eli5
