If the universe is infinite , how is it still expanding ? My teacher mentioned this one in my bio class . Can someone please explain ? Explain like I'm five.<>The statement \" the universe is infinite \" means \" given any distance , no matter how large , you can find two things in the universe that are at least that far apart . \" The statement \" the universe is expanding \" means \" given any two objects , if you measure the distance between them at one time , wait a bit , and then remeasure the distance , you 'll get a larger value the second time . \" Those two statements really have nothing to do with one another .<>The universe is vast and contains a tremendous amount of matter and energy, and it is constantly expanding. This means that the space between objects in the universe is getting larger over time.\n\nImagine you have a balloon with dots drawn on it. As you blow up the balloon, the dots move farther apart from each other. This is similar to how the universe is expanding - the objects within the universe (like galaxies) are moving farther apart from each other as the space between them increases.\n\nThe idea that the universe is expanding was first proposed by astronomer Edwin Hubble in the 1920s, and it has been supported by a great deal of scientific evidence. Scientists believe that the expansion of the universe began with the Big Bang, a tremendous explosion that occurred about 13.8 billion years ago and marked the beginning of our universe.\n\nIt's important to note that the expansion of the universe does not mean that everything in the universe is moving away from a central point. Instead, it's more like the fabric of space itself is expanding, and all objects within the universe are carried along with it.<>reddit_eli5
