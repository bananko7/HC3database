Why are sodas carbonated with Carbon Dioxide instead of oxygen ? We need oxygen to breathe , wo nt drinking sodas be alot smoother with other gases we can take in ? Please explain like I'm five.<>CO2 is much more soluble in water than any other non - toxic gas . The fizzy texture would be gone with other gases . [ Here are some numbers ] ( URL_0 ) .<>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is used to carbonate sodas because it is a gas that dissolves easily in water and other liquids. When CO2 is dissolved in a liquid, it creates tiny bubbles that make the liquid feel fizzy or bubbly on the tongue. Oxygen, on the other hand, does not dissolve as easily in liquids and would not create the same fizzy feeling in a soda. In addition to creating the fizziness that people enjoy in soda, CO2 also has a few other benefits. For example, it can help to preserve the flavor of the soda by preventing the growth of bacteria and other microorganisms that can cause the drink to spoil. CO2 can also help to keep the soda fresh by preventing the escape of volatile flavors and aromas. While it might be possible to carbonate sodas with other gases, CO2 is the most commonly used gas for this purpose because it is readily available, inexpensive, and has the desired effect on the drink.<>reddit_eli5
