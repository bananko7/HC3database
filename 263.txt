Why is gravity weaker at the core of the earth ? EDIT : Thank you all for your responses ! I get it now :) Explain like I'm five.<>It would n't be pulling you downwards as strongly because a lot of the Earth 's mass would then be above you . Say you 're in the inner core , for example , there would then be 5150 km worth of Earth no longer pulling you downwards . [ This might help you picture it better . ] ( URL_0 )<>Gravity is the force that attracts two objects with mass towards each other. The strength of gravity depends on the mass of the objects and the distance between them. So, if you are standing on the surface of the Earth, the Earth's mass is pulling you towards its center with a certain amount of force.\r\n\r\nThe Earth's mass is not evenly distributed throughout its interior. It is denser and heavier at the core, and less dense and lighter towards the surface. This means that the mass pulling you towards the center of the Earth is not the same all the way through. It is stronger closer to the core and weaker closer to the surface.\r\n\r\nSo, if you were at the core of the Earth, the mass pulling you towards the center would be much greater than it is at the surface. But, because you are much closer to the center, the distance between you and the mass is much smaller. This means that the force of gravity at the core of the Earth is actually weaker than it is at the surface, even though the mass pulling you towards the center is much greater.\r\n\r\nI hope that helps to explain it! Let me know if you have any more questions.<>reddit_eli5
