Why is there a cannabinoid receptor in our brain ? I mean , if Marijuana is ( supposedly ) so bad for you and you should n't do it , why is the receptor there ? Please explain like I'm five.<>The human body produces [ endocannabinoids ] ( URL_0 ) , which are molecules that bind to those receptors . It just so happens that several species of plant , the most notable of which is cannabis , also produce variations of cannaboid molecules that can bind to those same receptors .<>The endocannabinoid system, which includes the cannabinoid receptors found in the brain, plays a vital role in regulating many important functions in the body. These receptors are part of the nervous system and are involved in a wide range of processes, including pain sensation, mood, memory, and appetite. While marijuana is a plant that contains chemicals called cannabinoids, the body also naturally produces its own cannabinoids. These natural cannabinoids bind to the cannabinoid receptors in the brain and help to regulate various functions in the body. So, the reason there are cannabinoid receptors in the brain is because they serve an important purpose in helping the body to function properly. However, just because the body has cannabinoid receptors does not mean that it is safe or advisable to use marijuana or other substances that contain cannabinoids. Some of the potential risks associated with marijuana use include impaired memory and concentration, altered judgment and coordination, and increased heart rate. It is important to use caution when considering the use of any substance and to be aware of the potential risks and side effects.<>reddit_eli5
