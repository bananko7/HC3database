How could the US break into Kim DotCom 's compound and arrest him outside their jurisdiction ? How can the US enforce American Law internationally like that ? The political , legal and shady politics explanations are all perfectly acceptable ! Explain like I'm five.<>We 've had an extradition treaty with New Zealand since 1970 . URL_0<>The United States was able to arrest Kim DotCom and seize his property because New Zealand, where his compound was located, has an extradition treaty with the United States. This means that the U.S. can request that someone who is accused of a crime in the U.S. be brought back to the U.S. to stand trial.\n\nIn order to arrest someone in another country, the U.S. would typically need to work with the law enforcement agencies in that country. In the case of Kim DotCom, the U.S. requested that New Zealand authorities arrest him and turn him over to the U.S. for extradition. New Zealand authorities were able to enter his compound and arrest him because they had a warrant issued by a New Zealand court.\n\nIt is important to note that the U.S. cannot simply go into any country and arrest anyone they want. They must follow the laws and procedures of the country they are in, including obtaining the necessary warrants and working with local law enforcement agencies. However, through extradition treaties and other legal agreements, the U.S. is able to work with other countries to bring accused criminals to justice.<>reddit_eli5
