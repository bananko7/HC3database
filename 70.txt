Why is military equipment so expensive ? Like on how can a jet cost $ 62 million and a tomahawk missile cost $ 1.5 million ? Explain like I'm five.<>An elephant is a mouse built to a government specification . Most military gear is designed to work in extremely hostile environments , hot , cold , wet , vibration ... the list is long . One has to prove that it does so , which means a lot of testing . Accordingly , design costs are astronomical . Production , on the other hand , is often severely limited . If you can spread your design costs over millions of units , as happens in the consumer world , the per - unit amortised design cost is low . But when production is only a few tens of items , as in a fighter jet , the design cost per unit is high . Then there is tradition . Once opon a time , electronic devices were unreliable and cranky , two qualities the military can do without . Accordingly , elaborate procedures were put in place to make every component traceable to its source , in the hope that process problems could be found and corrected . These procedures are costly . Modern electronics is highly reliable , even under field conditions . Think what your cellphone endures . MIlitary purchasing has not caught up with this fact , it is still in the 1950s .<>Military equipment is expensive for several reasons. One reason is that it is designed to be very high quality and durable, so that it can perform well in demanding and harsh environments. This means that the materials and technology used to make military equipment are often more expensive than those used to make everyday products. Additionally, military equipment often needs to be customized and made in smaller quantities, which can also drive up the cost. Finally, the military needs to be prepared for a wide range of situations and missions, so they need to have a lot of different types of equipment, which can also be expensive.<>reddit_eli5
