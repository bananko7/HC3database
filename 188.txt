Does CPR work ? So thishttp:\/\/ URL_0 thread just informed me , CPR does not actually bring someone back to life and neither does a defibrillator . Can someone please enlighten me ? Explain like I'm five.<>CPR does indeed have a very low chance of fully reviving someone . I do n't remember the exact percentage , but it 's something around 10 % . The reason why it does n't work is because you only give CPR to someone without a pulse , which means their hearts might have stopped beating . Chest compressions do n't restart a heart That being said , CPR does help keep someone from dying . When you perform CPR , the chest compressions keep just enough oxygenated blood following through the casualty to prevent their brain from dying . They probably wo n't wake up , but they might not die either . What CPR is good for is buying time for medical treatment with drugs and more aggressive methods .<>CPR, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, is a procedure that is used to try to restart someone's heart and breathing when they have stopped. It is a potentially life-saving technique that can be performed by anyone, even if they have no medical training.\r\n\r\nDefibrillators are devices that can be used to try to restart someone's heart when it has stopped beating properly. They work by sending an electric shock to the person's heart in an attempt to restart it.\r\n\r\nIt is important to understand that CPR and defibrillators are not guaranteed to bring someone back to life. They are only tools that can be used to try to save someone's life in an emergency. However, they can be very effective in certain situations and can greatly increase a person's chances of survival.\r\n\r\nSo, to answer your question, CPR and defibrillators can be very helpful in certain situations, but they are not always successful in bringing someone back to life. It is always important to call 911 and get medical help as soon as possible in an emergency.<>reddit_eli5
