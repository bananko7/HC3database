Why do we close our eyes when we kiss ? Is it just a cultural thing or is there a scientific reason ? Please explain like I'm five.<>When kissing , your eyes do n't have much function , so closing them allows you to enhance your other senses that are more involved in the kiss : - taste of the other person - their smell - their caresses ( touch ) Also , I personally think it just feels awkward when kissing with eyes open - so that might be a cultural thing .<>Closing your eyes when you kiss is not a cultural thing, it is a natural human instinct. There are a few reasons why people close their eyes when they kiss. \nOne reason is that it helps to focus on the sensation of the kiss. When our eyes are open, we are processing a lot of visual information, which can be distracting. By closing our eyes, we can tune out distractions and focus on the physical sensations of the kiss, such as the warmth and softness of our partner's lips, the taste of their mouth, and the feeling of their breath on our skin. \nAnother reason is that closing our eyes can help us feel more connected to our partner. When we look at someone, we are using our eyes to see and understand what is going on around us. But when we close our eyes, we are trusting our partner and letting go of our need to see and control what is happening. This can create a deeper sense of intimacy and connection between two people. \nFinally, closing our eyes can also be a way to show affection and tenderness towards our partner. When we close our eyes and kiss, we are expressing our love and affection without the need for words. \nSo, in short, closing our eyes when we kiss helps us focus on the sensation of the kiss, feel more connected to our partner, and show affection towards them.<>reddit_eli5
