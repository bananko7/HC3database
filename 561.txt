the dosages of Splenda in this recent article how much would an average - sized human have to consume to get an equivalent dose to the rats in these articles ? URL_0 Please explain like I'm five.<>These other people have good answers , but always remember that rats and other test animals metabolize food differently than we do . Dogs , for instance , can be poisoned to death by eating a few grapes , sugarless gum , or some chocolate . So while it is useful to test things on rats first , it does n't tell us the whole story as to whether the substance would be toxic to humans as well .<>It's not possible for me to accurately determine the dosage of Splenda that an average-sized human would need to consume to get an equivalent dose to the rats in the articles without more information. In order to determine an appropriate dosage for humans, a number of factors would need to be considered, including the size and weight of the individual, the route of administration (e.g. oral, intravenous), and the specific effects that the researchers are trying to measure. Additionally, it's important to note that the results of studies conducted in animals may not necessarily be directly applicable to humans. Therefore, it's generally not recommended to try to calculate equivalent dosages based on animal studies.<>reddit_eli5
