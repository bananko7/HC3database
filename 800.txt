Why is the claim \" Carbon Dating is inaccurate and unreliable \" false ? I hear this from Christians all the time and I just want to hear why it does n't hold up . Explain like I'm five.<>It does n't hold up because carbon dates are backed up and supported by a variety of dating methods from multiple other fields such as ice cores , tree rings , earth strata horizons , magnetostratigraphy , luminescence , exposure dating , incremental archeology etc . etc . Young earthers like to pick on a few of the inherent weaknesses in Radiocarbon dating and blow them up to enormous levels while ignoring all the * other * supporting evidence which , when cross - referenced , makes a strong case . In simple terms the argument goes like this : * Scientist :* \" Bob says Sarah is twenty years old . \" * Young earther :* \" But Bob has been wrong before , so he must be wrong this time . \" * Scientist :* \" But John , Chris , Helen , Kim , Dennis , Gladys , Justin , Christy , Alex , Adam , Stephanie , Emma , Jack , Rod , Greg , Lisa , Brian , Jason , Walter , Amy , Ashley , Max , Ed , Alice , Todd , Nancy , Jill , Kevin , Val , and Marie also all say that Sarah is twenty years old ... \" * Young earther :* \" I do n't care about all that , Bob has been wrong before so Sarah is not Twenty years old . \"<>Carbon dating is a method used to determine the age of certain materials, such as fossils and artifacts, by measuring the amount of carbon-14, a radioactive isotope of carbon, that is present in them. The idea behind carbon dating is based on the fact that carbon-14 is constantly being produced in the Earth's atmosphere. When an organism dies, it stops taking in carbon-14, and the carbon-14 that it contains begins to decay at a predictable rate. By measuring the amount of carbon-14 left in a sample, scientists can determine how long ago the organism died.\r\n\r\nCarbon dating has been used for many years and has been proven to be accurate and reliable. It has been used to date a wide range of materials, including wood, bones, shells, and other materials. There are several factors that can affect the accuracy of carbon dating, such as the age and condition of the sample, the methods used to prepare the sample, and the equipment used to measure the carbon-14. However, these factors can be controlled for and compensated for, and scientists have developed rigorous methods to ensure that carbon dating results are as accurate as possible.\r\n\r\nIn summary, carbon dating is a reliable and accurate method for determining the age of certain materials. It is not perfect, but it is the best method we have for dating materials that are thousands or even millions of years old.<>reddit_eli5
