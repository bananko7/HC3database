Why do dogs and cats with socks on walk so stupidly ? I 'm sure the answer is obvious but I find it weird how all of them walk the exact same way with socks or shoes on . Explain like I'm five.
They are used to walk bare paws , and they can feel the ground that way . When they have socks or shoes on , they are feeling that instead of the ground . And unlike with the ground , the feeling does n't stop when they lift their paws . So they keep lifting , in an attempt to get away from the thing that they can feel . This is why they have a funny walk where they lift their paws very high .
Dogs and cats walk strangely with socks or shoes on because they are not used to wearing them. Socks and shoes can feel strange and uncomfortable on their paws, and they may not be able to grip the ground as well as they can without them. This can cause them to walk more slowly or unsteadily as they try to adjust to the unfamiliar sensation. Additionally, some dogs and cats may be more sensitive to wearing socks or shoes than others, which can also cause them to walk differently. Overall, it is not uncommon for dogs and cats to walk strangely with socks or shoes on, but they will usually get used to them over time and begin to walk more normally.
