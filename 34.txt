programming languages . How are they made ? Why are they different?How is one more powerful than another ? Explain like I'm five.<>At the most basic level , everything happens in binary . Programming in Binary is hard , and not really something you want to do . One of the first ' programming language ' concepts was Assembly . [ You can see how it works here ] ( URL_3 ) , but in essence , the idea was ' instead of doing this in binary , why do n't we create an actual phrase or command that , when translated , becomes binary ? ' At some point , people said , ' Assembly is kind of basic - maybe we can do a bit more than this . ' Thus born were languages like BASIC and FORTRAN , which allowed for more complex operations to be described with more ease than with Assembly . [ For instance , with Fortran ] ( URL_0 ) or [ BASIC ] ( URL_1 ) we are seeing more human language - commands are less ambiguous in their function , there is more flexibility , we can create comments . From there , newer programming languages were designed to allow for even more flexibility , power , the ability to create more complicated projects using simpler code . C and other object oriented languages come along and lets you define [ classes ] ( URL_2 ) and build off of inheritance and hierarchies and all kinds of other stuff , and suddenly there are all kinds of new interesting things you can do . In general , as programming languages have evolved , they are each powerful in their own way . You can still dig down and learn assembly and write some useful programs . If you are doing complex number calculations , FORTRAN might still be your go - to language . Depending on what you want to do , there are any number of languages available that might be the ' right ' one for you . Each language takes its own philosophy in how code is compiled and translated , and based on that philosophy , the ' power ' of that language will vary dramatically from one to the next .<>Programming languages are made by people called computer scientists. These computer scientists design the programming language to make it easier for people to give instructions to a computer.\r\n\r\nDifferent programming languages are made for different purposes. Some programming languages are good for making websites, while others are good for building apps or games. Some programming languages are also made to be easy for beginners to learn, while others are more difficult but can do more powerful things.\r\n\r\nOne programming language can be more powerful than another because it can do more things or it can do things faster. For example, some programming languages are better at solving math problems quickly, while others are better at organizing large amounts of data.\r\n\r\nOverall, programming languages are like different tools that people can use to tell computers what to do. Just like how you might use a hammer to build a house and a pencil to write a letter, different programming languages are used for different tasks on a computer.<>reddit_eli5
