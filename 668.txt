Where does the money go when I buy stocks?<>The money goes to the seller.  There are a lot of behind the scenes things that happen, and some transactions are very complicated with many parties involved (evidenced by all the comments on @keshlam's perfectly reasonable high-level answer), but ultimately the money goes to the seller.  Sometimes the seller is the company.  The billions of shares that change hands each day are moving between other individuals like you and investment funds; these transactions have no direct impact on the company's financials, in general.<>When you buy stocks, you are purchasing ownership in a company. The money you pay for the stocks goes to the company or to the current shareholder who is selling the stock.When a company issues stock, it is essentially selling ownership in the company to the public in the form of shares. The money that is raised from the sale of the stock is used to fund the company's operations and to finance its growth.When you buy stocks, you are essentially buying a piece of the company. You become a shareholder and are entitled to a share of the company's profits, if any, through dividends. You may also be able to sell your stocks at a later date for a profit if the value of the company has increased since you purchased the stock.<>finance
