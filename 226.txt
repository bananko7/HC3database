Black holes vs. white holes . Please explain the difference as well the the theoretical value of both to mankind . Explain like I'm five.<>> In general relativity , a white hole , is a hypothetical region of spacetime which can not be entered from the outside ; but matter and light can escape from it . In this sense , it is the reverse of a black hole , which can be entered from the outside , but from which nothing , including light , has the ability to escape I got this off of wikipedia<>Black holes and white holes are both regions of space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. They are both predicted by the theory of general relativity, which explains how gravity works.\r\n\r\nA black hole is a region of space where gravity is so strong that nothing can escape from it, not even light. Black holes are formed when a star collapses at the end of its life and becomes very dense. There are three main types of black holes: small ones called \"stellar\" black holes, medium-sized ones called \"intermediate\" black holes, and supermassive black holes that can be millions or billions of times more massive than the sun.\r\n\r\nA white hole is the opposite of a black hole. It is a region of space where nothing can enter, but everything can escape. In other words, it is the \"exit\" of a black hole. White holes are purely theoretical and have never been observed. They are not expected to exist in the real universe because they violate the laws of thermodynamics, which are basic laws that govern how energy and matter behave.\r\n\r\nThe theoretical value of black holes to mankind is that they can help us understand the laws of physics and the nature of the universe. Black holes are very mysterious objects and scientists are still trying to understand how they work and what they can tell us about the universe. Some scientists believe that black holes could be portals to other parts of the universe or even other dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe theoretical value of white holes to mankind is less clear, since they are purely theoretical and are not expected to exist in the real universe. However, some scientists believe that the concept of a white hole could help us understand the nature of black holes and the laws of physics that govern them.<>reddit_eli5
