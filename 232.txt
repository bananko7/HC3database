Why does having your back scratched feel so damn good ? Getting scratched anywhere else is a pretty meh , maybe even uncomfortable . But having someone else scratch your back is the best thing in the world . Why ? Explain like I'm five.<>I need this explained . My husband does n't understand that I * need * my back to be scratched . I feel that our vows are n't being fulfilled without appropriate back scratching .<>When someone scratches your back, it stimulates your nerves, which sends a signal to your brain that feels good. The skin on your back has a lot of nerve endings, which makes it especially sensitive to touch and feel good when it is touched. Scratching can also help to relax your muscles and make you feel more comfortable and at ease.<>reddit_eli5
