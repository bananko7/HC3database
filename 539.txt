Why do people say \" half a dozen \" instead of \" six \" ? It seems like such a common occurrence . Why take the time and effort to say the extra three syllables ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Even though they both mean 6 , half a dozen also means that something is half of a set of 12 -- I 've now conveyed more information about the thing than I would have with ' six ' . Also , why not just say two instead of a couple , or \" three or four \" instead of a few ? There are a lot of ways to say the same thing in English , so it 's really up to the way you learned to speak .<>\"Half a dozen\" means six. People say it because it's a way to talk about a small number of things. It's like saying \"one, two, three, four, five, six\" all at once. It's just a shorter way to say it. It's like how we say \"a pair of shoes\" instead of \"two shoes.\" It's just a way to talk about things in a compact way. Does that make sense?<>reddit_eli5
