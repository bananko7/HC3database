Is it possible to allocate pre-tax money to a specific stock?<>Whether an investment is pre-tax is determined by the type of account (i.e., tax-advantaged vs ordinary taxable account), but whether you can invest in individual stocks is determined by the provider (i.e., the particular bank where you have the account).  These are orthogonal choices.  If you want to invest in individual stocks, you need to look for a bank that offers an IRA\/401k\/other tax-advantaged account and allows you to invest in individual stocks with it.  For example, this page suggests that Fidelity would let you do that.  Obviously you should look into various providers yourself to find one that offers the mix of features you want.<>Yes, it is possible to allocate pre-tax money to a specific stock as part of a taxable investment account. This can be done by purchasing the stock through a brokerage account or other investment platform.However, it's important to note that investing in a specific stock carries inherent risks, as the value of the stock can fluctuate significantly over time. It's generally recommended to diversify your investment portfolio by holding a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets, rather than concentrating your investments in a single stock.If you want to use pre-tax money to invest in stocks while also taking advantage of tax benefits, you may want to consider opening a tax-advantaged investment account such as a 401(k) or traditional IRA. These types of accounts allow you to contribute pre-tax money and potentially benefit from tax-deferred growth on your investments.<>finance
