How could the universe expand faster than the speed of light ( Inflation ) ? I was reading about inflation of the cosmos and I ca n't fathom this idea . Thank you for answering ! Explain like I'm five.<>The \" speed limit \" of * c * ( speed of light ) is in reference to movement * through * space . Nothing about inflation theory suggests violation of that . In other words , while space itself may have been expanding unfathomably fast , nothing within the universe itself was moving that fast .<>The concept of the universe expanding faster than the speed of light is a difficult one to wrap your head around, and it can be hard to explain it in simple terms. But I'll do my best!\r\n\r\nDuring inflation, the universe expands at an incredibly fast rate. But it's important to note that this expansion is not like the movement of objects through space. Instead, it's the space itself that is expanding.\r\n\r\nImagine you have a balloon with dots painted on it. As you blow up the balloon, the dots will move farther and farther apart from each other. The dots aren't moving through the balloon; they are just getting farther apart because the balloon is getting bigger. In the same way, during inflation, the space between galaxies and other objects in the universe is getting bigger, even though the objects themselves aren't moving.\r\n\r\nInflation is thought to have happened very early in the history of the universe, when the universe was still very small. At that time, the universe was expanding much faster than the speed of light, but this is allowed because the expansion was not happening within the space that we know and experience. Instead, it was the space itself that was expanding.\r\n\r\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.<>reddit_eli5
