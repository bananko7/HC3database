Why the US is n't building skyscrapers and other architecturally amazing buildings like other countries . Such as China , Japan or Dubi Explain like I'm five.<>We 've had our skyscraper race already . We 've proven again and again we can build them as tall as anyone else . But some of these newly - developed and newly - wealthy countries want to prove that they can , too . And beyond a certain height--50 stories , or so -- a taller skyscraper is not necessarily more cost effective than * more * shorter skyscrapers . Beyond a certain height , it becomes a prestige project . I will reserve my judgement until they can seriously compete with companies such as Boeing , Airbus , Apple , Intel , and plenty of others I could name . Because building supertall skyscrapers is child 's play compared to airframes , CPU 's , and market - disrupting products .<>There are a few reasons why the US may not be building as many skyscrapers and other architecturally amazing buildings as other countries like China, Japan, or Dubai.\r\n\r\nOne reason is that the US already has a lot of tall buildings and large cities, so there may not be as much demand for new skyscrapers. Additionally, building skyscrapers and other large buildings can be very expensive and time-consuming, so developers may not see as much financial benefit in building them.\r\n\r\nAnother reason is that the US has a lot of regulations and rules that govern how buildings can be constructed, which can make it more difficult and costly to build large, complex structures. In other countries, there may be fewer regulations or different regulations that make it easier to build such structures.\r\n\r\nFinally, the style and design of buildings in the US may be different from those in other countries. In the US, there may be a preference for more traditional or classic styles of architecture, while other countries may be more open to more modern or innovative designs.<>reddit_eli5
