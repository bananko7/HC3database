Why do beavers make dams ? Do they live in them ? Are there little beaver apartments inside ? Also , are beavers just fat otters ? Explain like I'm five.<>Beavers build lodges next to streams to live in . The living spaces are high and the entrances are low . They build dams so the entrances to the lodges become underwater while the living spaces stay above water .. Since the entrance is underwater things that ca n't swim ca n't get in , since the living spaces are above water , things that can only swim ca n't get in . [ Here 's a picture of both the dam and the lodge with a dachshund for scale . ] ( URL_0 ) Note how the lodge is entirely surrounded by water , if the living space was in the dam , things that ca n't swim could walk along the dam to the living space . So yes and no , the little beaver apartment is upstream from the dam , but not inside the dam .<>\\nBeavers build dams to create a safe place to live and raise their young. The dams help protect the beavers from predators, and they also provide a constant source of water for the beavers to drink and swim in. Beavers do live in the dams they build, and they have little rooms inside the dams where they can sleep and rest.\\n\\nBeavers are not fat otters. Otters are a different type of animal that lives in the water and has a long, slender body. Beavers have a much thicker, stockier build and are adapted for life on land and in the water. They have webbed feet for swimming and a flat, paddle-shaped tail that they use to help them swim and steer. Beavers also have large incisors (front teeth) that they use to cut down trees and build their dams. Otters do not have these same adaptations.<>reddit_eli5
