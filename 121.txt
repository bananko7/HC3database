why do minor chords give us that sad feeling ? Is it a genetical thing or is it something we get used to associate while growing up ? Explain like I'm five. <>The major triad has a consonant or pleasing sound because the frequencies all blend -- they are in the proportion 4:5:6 . The minor triad frequencies have the proportion 10:12:15 . So for the 3 notes of a minor chord , the bottom note vibrates 10 times for every 12 vibrations of the second note and 15 vibrations of the third note . But why the multiple proportion 4:5:6 would be heard almost universally as bright and happy , and the minor triad as more sombre and serious or sad is still unknown . It stands out though , that the major triad is a much * simpler * ratio than the minor . Possibly it has something to do with the ease of difficulty in which our brain \/ mind can resolve these vibration ratios and find patterns of harmony and order within them . ( Or perhaps feelings \/ emotions themselves have frequencies \/ waveforms that share a commonality of shape with the wave patterns in sound , and our brain triggers a match which ignites the emotional sensation ! ) But surely it must have something to do with these ratios , and the brain as a pattern - identifying machine , and as emotions themselves as somehow linked to these basic patterns , whether genetically or through cultural associations .<>Minor chords are often associated with a sad or melancholy feeling because they have a particular sound that tends to evoke emotions in people. This is not a genetic thing, but rather something that people have learned to associate with certain types of music.\\n\\nMusic is made up of different notes, and the way these notes are arranged can create different feelings or moods. Minor chords are made up of three notes, and they are arranged in a way that creates a particular sound. This sound is often described as being sad or melancholy, and it can evoke similar emotions in people who hear it.\\n\\nSo, while it is not a genetic thing, it is possible that people may be more likely to associate minor chords with sadness if they have heard a lot of music that uses minor chords in a way that creates a sad or melancholy feeling.\\n<>reddit_eli5
