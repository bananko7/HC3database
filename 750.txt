Why do so many baby boomers have Hep C ? I 'm seeing this commercial over and over about 1 in 30 baby boomers having hep C ..... why ? Explain like I'm five.<>Good question . Studies have pretty consistently found that the prevalence of hep C is [ 6x greater \\(approximately 2.6%\\ ) ] ( URL_0 ) in those born between 1945 - 1965 than the general population . Why is this ? It 's most likely that these people were infected by [ contaminated blood products \/ medical equipment ] ( URL_1 ) before we had widespread screening ( 1992 ) , disposable medical equipment , and a good understanding of bloodborne disease . While injection drug use or high - risk sexual practices are other contributing factors they 're less likely to have caused the numbers we see .<>\\nHepatitis C is a virus that can cause liver infection and damage. It is spread through blood-to-blood contact, usually through the sharing of needles or equipment to inject drugs. Baby boomers (people born between 1946 and 1964) may be more likely to have been infected with hepatitis C because the virus was more common in the past and people were less aware of how to prevent its spread. In addition, baby boomers may have been more likely to use drugs in the past, which can increase the risk of contracting hepatitis C. It is also possible that some baby boomers may have been infected through blood transfusions or organ transplants before widespread screening for the virus was implemented.<>reddit_eli5
