Why ca n't spiders climb up the side of the bath tub ? To confirm , I did n't kill the spider , I put it outside . They 're great for getting rid of pesky bugs , plus ... Live and let live right ? Explain like I'm five.<>They climb using the hairs and little microscopic hooks . Think of it like rock climbing . If there were n't any type of way to hold on to something with your hands and feet you would n't be able to climb a nearly vertical wall . Same is true for the spider . The tub is a smooth and relatively vertical surface for them to climb .<>Spiders are able to climb up the side of a bathtub, but they might have difficulty doing so if the surface is too smooth or slippery. This is because spiders use tiny hairy structures on their legs called setae to cling to surfaces. These setae are so small that they can only grip onto rough or porous surfaces, and they do not work as well on smooth surfaces like glass or ceramic.\r\n\r\nThink of it like trying to climb a tree with gloves on your hands. The gloves would make it harder for you to grip the rough bark of the tree, and you might slip and fall off. The same thing can happen to spiders when they try to climb up a smooth surface like a bathtub.\r\n\r\nIt's important to remember that spiders are beneficial to have around because they help to control pest populations. It's always a good idea to try to catch and release spiders outside rather than squashing them or using pesticides.<>reddit_eli5
