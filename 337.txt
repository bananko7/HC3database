What does a small lump inside the left cheek indicate?I have a small lump inside my left cheek, I can only feel it when i use my thumb a pointer finger to squeeze the inside & outside of my cheek at the same time.

There are many possible causes of a lump in the cheek, and it's not necessarily a sign of cancer. Some possible causes of a lump in the cheek include:\n\nSalivary gland infection or blockage: The salivary glands produce saliva and can become infected or blocked, leading to swelling and a lump in the cheek.\n\nOral cancer: While cancer is a possibility, it's important to note that oral cancer is relatively rare and there are often other symptoms present, such as a sore that does not heal, difficulty swallowing, and unexplained weight loss.\n\nDental abscess: A dental abscess is a collection of pus that forms in response to an infection. It can cause a swollen cheek and other symptoms such as fever, tooth pain, and difficulty swallowing.\n\nCyst: A cyst is a closed sac containing fluid or semisolid material. It can occur anywhere in the body and may cause a lump in the cheek.\n\nIt's important to see a doctor or dentist for an examination and diagnosis if you are concerned about a lump in your cheek. They will be able to determine the cause and recommend the appropriate treatment.<>medicine
