The difference between Major and Minor keys in music I know that each major key has a relative minor key that has the same notes , and vice versa , so what 's the difference ? Explain like I'm five.<>What defines the sound of a key is the spacing between notes . In the Western system of music , we have 7 notes per octave , but 13 ' steps ' per octave . This gives the possible notes as ; A , A#\/Bb , B , C , C#\/Db , D , D#\/Eb , E , F , F#\/Gb , G , G#\/Ab , A [ EDIT : Whoops , forgot a few things in there . That was daft ] You 'll notice that the sharp of one note is the same note as the flat of another in the places where there 's a distinct spacing for a sharp or flat . A sharp is the same note as B flat . In other cases , the sharp is the same note as a higher note ; B sharp is the same note as C. ( The notation you use will be dependent upon the key you 're in , but that 's afield of the question ) So what makes a major scale major is the distance between the notes . If you move 1 position up in the 13 - position scale I mentioned , it 's called a half - step ( abbreviated H ) . If you move 2 positions up , it 's a whole - step ( abbreviated W ) . A major key is distinguished by the steps ; WWHWWWH If you start at C , this gives you ; C , D , E , F , G , A , B , C A minor key is distinguished by the steps ; WHWWHWW If you start at C , this gives you ; C , D , D # , F , G , G # , A # , C<>​\r\n\r\n\r\n···\r\nChatGPT Dec 15 Version.
