why do n't we have more roundabouts since they minimize traffic ? Thank you . Explain like I'm five.
They do n't get rid of traffic . They get rid of the need of traffic lights .
Roundabouts are a type of traffic control that can be used to help manage the flow of vehicles at intersections. They work by having all the cars entering the roundabout yield to the cars already in the roundabout, and then take turns entering the roundabout and exiting at their desired street. This can help to minimize traffic because it allows cars to keep moving without having to stop at a red light or stop sign.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are a few reasons why we don't have more roundabouts in some places:\r\n\r\nCost: Building a roundabout can be more expensive than installing traffic lights or stop signs, especially if the area needs to be redesigned or reconfigured to accommodate the roundabout.\r\n\r\nSpace: Roundabouts take up more space than traffic lights or stop signs, so they may not be practical in areas where there is limited space available.\r\n\r\nConfusion: Some people may not be familiar with how roundabouts work, which can lead to confusion and accidents.\r\n\r\nTraffic volume: Roundabouts are most effective at intersections with lower to moderate levels of traffic. In areas with very high traffic volumes, other types of traffic control may be more effective at managing the flow of vehicles.\r\n\r\nOverall, while roundabouts can be a useful tool for managing traffic, they are not always the best solution for every intersection.
