A person who is against vaccinations just told me that diseases like the bubonic plague \" disappeared \" without the use of vaccines ... I do n't understand epidemiology can someone explain these outbursts and \" dormancy \" periods of diseases ? Thanks Explain like I'm five.<>... that has to be , like , the silliest argument in the world . I mean , the plague killed millions and millions of people , so it 's not like it just went away on its own and everything was fine . Also , there have been a couple extremely deadly flu epidemics , and we all know flu vaccines work pretty damn well . The Spanish Flu epidemic in 1918 killed upwards of 50 million people , and I do n't think we want a repeat of that . Anyway , the way that pandemics end is that people develop an immunity . If you catch the plague but do n't die from it , you wo n't get it again because your body knows how to fight it off . You do n't even have to get sick to build an immunity , it 's possible that your body will get a small enough infection that it just gets fought off without you noticing . So , eventually there 's a point where the infectious agent just sort of fades away because it ca n't survive in people 's immune systems anymore . No viable hosts , no disease . This is actually * exactly * how vaccines work , and why they 're so effective . They give you a very mild \" dose \" of the disease ( or a deactivated version of the virus in many cases ) , which your body can easily fight off . Once it 's fought a disease off , it \" remembers \" how to fight it off again . edit : As \/u \/ LondonPilot pointed out , quarantining is also an important part of it . There may still be people around who do n't have an immunity to the disease , but if you keep the sick people away from them , the virus will die out before it can reach those people .<>Sure! I can try to explain this in a way that is easy to understand.\r\n\r\nThe bubonic plague, also known as the Black Death, was a disease that caused a lot of death and suffering in the past. It is caused by a type of bacteria called Yersinia pestis and it can be spread to humans through the bites of infected fleas.\r\n\r\nThe bubonic plague disappeared, or stopped being a major problem, for a few reasons. One reason is that it became less common for people to come into contact with the bacteria that causes the plague. This happened because people started living in cities and towns instead of in rural areas, which made it less likely for people to come into contact with infected animals or fleas.\r\n\r\nAnother reason is that people started using antibiotics to treat the plague. These are medications that can kill the bacteria that cause the disease, which can help people recover from the plague if they catch it.\r\n\r\nFinally, some diseases can go through periods of dormancy, or inactivity. This means that the disease is not spreading or causing new infections, but it is still present in the population. The bubonic plague may have gone through periods of dormancy, which means that it was not causing new infections but it was still present in the population.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps to explain why the bubonic plague disappeared and why some diseases can go through periods of dormancy.
