Why does Molasses spoil while Honey does n't ? By my understanding , Honey is so concentrated in sugar content that it sucks water out of the bacteria . Would n't Mollasses do the same ? Explain like I'm five. <>It 's a threshold issue : A fluid compound need 20 % water to support bacterial growth . Molasses is about 25 % water whereas honey is about 17 - 18 % water . That 's is why Molasses will ' go bad ' but honey will not .<>Honey and molasses are both sweeteners made from plant sugars, but they differ in their processing and composition.\\n\\nHoney is made by bees from the nectar of flowers. Bees collect the nectar and bring it back to the hive, where they add enzymes to it that break down the complex sugars into simpler sugars, like glucose and fructose. The bees also fan the nectar with their wings to help evaporate some of the water from it. This helps to thicken the honey and make it more concentrated.\\n\\nMolasses, on the other hand, is a byproduct of the sugar refining process. Sugar cane or sugar beets are crushed to extract their juice, which is then boiled down to form a syrup. This syrup is then further processed to make white sugar crystals, which are separated from the syrup by centrifugation. The remaining syrup is called molasses.\\n\\nHoney has a low water content and is high in sugar, which makes it inhospitable to most bacteria and fungi. The high sugar concentration and low water activity of honey can inhibit the growth and metabolism of microorganisms, making it difficult for them to survive. In addition, honey also contains small amounts of hydrogen peroxide, which can act as an antimicrobial agent.\\n\\nMolasses, on the other hand, has a higher water content and is lower in sugar than honey. This makes it more conducive to the growth of bacteria and fungi, which can cause it to spoil over time. Molasses also does not contain the same antimicrobial compounds found in honey, which further increases its susceptibility to spoilage.\\n\\nIn summary, honey is less prone to spoilage than molasses because it has a higher sugar concentration, lower water content, and antimicrobial properties that help to inhibit the growth of microorganisms.<>reddit_eli5
