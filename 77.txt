Is buying and selling Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrency) legal for a student on F-1 Visa doing OPT in USA?
Given your clarification that you re only intending to use cryptocurrency as a capital asset & a long term investment vehicle, and not as a business day trading or trading for others, I would say this definitely is NOT illegal. The tax man says cryptocurrency is property. The IRS made this clear in Notice 2014-21.  As long as you report it every time you do transfer it and an income loss\/gain is triggered, I see nothing wrong here.
In the United States, buying and selling Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is generally legal. However, there may be some restrictions depending on your specific circumstances.If you are on an F-1 visa and participating in Optional Practical Training (OPT) in the United States, you are generally allowed to engage in activities that are consistent with your visa status, including buying and selling Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. However, you should be aware of the potential tax implications of such transactions.In general, you may need to report any gains or losses from the sale of cryptocurrency on your federal income tax return. It is important to consult with a tax professional or refer to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) guidelines for more information about how to report cryptocurrency transactions on your tax return.It is also important to note that the regulations surrounding the use of cryptocurrencies can vary from one jurisdiction to another. If you are planning to buy or sell cryptocurrency while you are in the United States, it is a good idea to familiarize yourself with the specific laws and regulations that apply in your location.
