Why are buttons on a shirt on the right hand side but on a blouse they are on the left hand side ? Buttons are on the right of a man 's shirt but on the left of a ladies blouse . Why is that ? Explain like I'm five.<>I 've been told it 's because , in the past , wealthy women were dressed by their ( right - handed ) servants , so the buttons were positioned to make it easy for them to fasten them . Wealthy men buttoned their own shirts . Not sure if it 's 100 % true , but it seems reasonable enough .<>The traditional reason for this difference is that men's shirts were originally designed for practicality and ease of use, while women's blouses were more decorative and were often fastened by someone else.\r\n\r\nFor a man, it is easier to button a shirt with the buttons on the right side because he is typically right-handed. He can use his dominant hand to button the shirt without having to contort his body or reach awkwardly.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, blouses were often worn by women who had someone else, such as a maid or a husband, to help them dress. The buttons were placed on the left side so that the person helping with the buttons could easily reach them and fasten them.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that these traditional gender roles and styles of dress have changed over time, and today many people wear clothing with buttons on either side, regardless of their gender.<>reddit_eli5
