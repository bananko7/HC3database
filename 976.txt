How do one make acid stronger ? I understand the PH - scale but i do nt understand how you make acid stronger ( make it rank lower on the ph - scale ) ? Please explain like I'm five.<>There are two aspects to this . One , as others have said , is concentration of the acid in a solution - the higher the concentration , the lower the pH - for the same acid ! But 10 % solution of HCl and HBr wo nt have the same pH , that is where the strength of the acid comes in . Different acids have different \" dissociation constant \" - willingness to let the H+ go . Generally that is determinated by the stability of the resulting anion , in this case Cl- and Br- . The more stable the anion the stronger the acid - the less of it you need to achieve a solution with the same pH. My point is that pH does n't necessarily correlate with acid strength , which is something your question implied . While they are closely related , they are two very different things . If you specify which exactly you are interested in - pH or acid strength - i could provide more detailed information :-)<>Acids are substances that release hydrogen ions (H+) when they are dissolved in water. The concentration of H+ ions in a solution determines how acidic the solution is, and this is measured on the pH scale. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with 0 being the most acidic, 7 being neutral, and 14 being the most basic. To make an acid stronger, you can increase the concentration of H+ ions in the solution. This can be done by adding more acid to the solution, or by diluting the solution with less water. The more H+ ions there are in the solution, the lower the pH will be, and the stronger the acid will be.<>reddit_eli5
