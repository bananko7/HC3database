When following a buy and hold investment strategy, on what conditions should one sell?<>You talk about an individual not being advised to sell (or purchase) in response to trends in the market in such a buy and hold strategy. But think of this for a moment: You buy stock ABC for $10 when both the market as a whole and stock ABC are near the bottom of a bear market as say part of a value buying strategy. You've now held stock ABC for a number of years and it is performing well hitting $50. There is all good news about stock ABC, profit increases year after year in double digits. Would you consider selling this stock just because it has increased 400%. It could start falling in a general market crash or it could keep going up to $100 or more. Maybe a better strategy to sell ABC would be to place a trailing stop of say 20% on the highest price reached by the stock. So if ABC falls, say in a general market correction, by less than 20% off its high and then rebounds and goes higher - you keep it. If ABC however falls by more than 20% off its high you automatically sell it with your stop loss order. You may give 20% back to the market if the market or the stock crashes, but if the stock continues going up you benefit from more upside in the price. Take AAPL as an example, if you bought AAPL in March 2009, after the GFC, for about $100, would you have sold it in December 2011 when it hit $400. If you did you would have left money on the table. If instead you placed a trailing stop loss on AAPL of 20% you would have been still in it when it hit its high of $702 in September 2012. You would have finally been stopped out in November 2012 for around the $560 mark, and made an extra $160 per share. And if your thinking, how about if I decided to sell AAPL at $700, well I don't think many would have picked $700 as the high in hindsight. The main benefit of using stop losses is that it takes your emotions out of your trading, especially your exits.<>Buy and hold is an investment strategy in which an investor buys stocks or other securities and holds onto them for a long period of time, regardless of short-term price fluctuations. The idea is to buy good quality investments and hold onto them for the long term, with the expectation that they will appreciate in value over time.There are a few conditions under which an investor might consider selling a stock or other security that they are holding as part of a buy and hold strategy:If the company's financial health deteriorates significantly: If a company's financial health deteriorates significantly, it may be a good idea to sell the stock. This could be due to declining revenues, increasing debt, or other financial problems.If the investment no longer aligns with the investor's goals or risk tolerance: If an investor's goals or risk tolerance changes, they may decide to sell an investment that no longer aligns with their goals or risk tolerance. For example, an investor who becomes more risk-averse may decide to sell a high-risk stock.If a better investment opportunity arises: If an investor becomes aware of a better investment opportunity, they may decide to sell an existing investment in order to reallocate their capital to the new opportunity.It's important to keep in mind that buy and hold is a long-term investment strategy, and it's generally not a good idea to sell investments based on short-term price fluctuations. Instead, investors should focus on the long-term prospects of the companies they are invested in and only sell if there are significant changes in the company's financial health or if the investment no longer aligns with the investor's goals or risk tolerance.","Buy and hold is an investment strategy that involves buying stocks or other securities and holding onto them for a long period of time, rather than actively trading them. The goal of this strategy is to benefit from the potential long-term growth of the securities, rather than trying to make short-term profits through trading.There are a few different conditions under which one might consider selling securities that are being held as part of a buy and hold strategy:A change in investment goals: If your investment goals have changed and the securities you are holding no longer align with your new goals, it may be appropriate to sell them and invest the proceeds in securities that better match your current objectives.A change in the underlying company: If the company whose securities you are holding experiences significant changes that you believe will negatively impact its long-term prospects, you may want to sell the securities. For example, if the company is facing financial difficulties or undergoing significant management changes, it may be a good time to consider selling.Diversification: If you have a concentrated position in a single security or a small number of securities, you may want to sell some of them in order to diversify your portfolio. This can help to reduce risk by spreading your investments across a larger number of securities.Rebalancing: If the value of your securities has changed significantly relative to your other investments, you may want to sell some of them in order to rebalance your portfolio and maintain your desired asset allocation.It's important to note that selling securities as part of a buy and hold strategy should generally be done with caution, as it can trigger capital gains taxes and may also reduce your potential for long-term growth. It's a good idea to carefully consider your investment goals and the factors that may influence your decision to sell before making any changes to your portfolio.<>finance
