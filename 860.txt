Why does ~55 mph seem to be the sweet spot for car MPG efficiency ? Why is it that about 55 mph is the sweet spot for best MPG efficiency , given normal driving conditions ? Explain like I'm five.<>Quick Answer : It is . Most vehicles will reach their final gear ( 4th , 5th , 6th , 7th or even 8th ) at around 55 mph . The vehicle has usually reached the maximum speed at the lowest rpm possible ( engine spins slower ) . Also air resistance increases the faster you go obviously so the engine does n't need to work as hard to overcome aerodynamic drag .<>The sweet spot for a car's fuel efficiency is the speed at which the car uses the least amount of fuel to travel a certain distance. This is because the amount of fuel a car uses depends on several factors, including the speed at which it is driven, the weight of the car, the drag on the car (caused by wind resistance and other factors), and the efficiency of the engine.\r\n\r\nAt lower speeds, a car's engine is not working as hard, so it uses less fuel. However, as the car's speed increases, so does the drag on the car, which means the engine has to work harder to overcome the resistance and maintain the higher speed. This leads to an increase in fuel consumption.\r\n\r\nAt very high speeds, the drag on the car becomes even greater, which means the engine has to work even harder and use even more fuel.\r\n\r\nSo, there is a sweet spot for fuel efficiency where the engine is working hard enough to maintain a reasonable speed, but not so hard that it is using a lot of fuel. For most cars, this sweet spot is around 55 mph. At this speed, the car is able to maintain a good balance between fuel efficiency and speed.<>reddit_eli5
