Why doesn't Japan just divide the Yen by 100? <>Some answers already informed about denomination. There are currencies, doing the cut off of two digits, for example the french franc. See http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/French_franc#New_franc  When you look to old french movies, they often talked about 'old franc' when talking about values (at least in French original, I don't know what happens in English translations).<>It is possible for a country to divide its currency by a certain amount in order to create smaller units, but it is not a decision that is taken lightly. Such a move can have significant economic consequences and requires careful consideration and planning.In the case of Japan, the decision to divide the yen by 100 was made in the late 19th century when the country was undergoing rapid modernization and economic growth. At that time, the yen was divided into 100 sen, which made it easier to conduct transactions and facilitated trade with other countries. The division of the yen into smaller units has remained in place since then and is now an integral part of Japan's monetary system.It is worth noting that many countries have gone through similar processes of currency division in the past, including the United States, which divided the dollar into 100 cents in the late 18th century.<>finance
