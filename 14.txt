Can explosions send you flying in the air in real life if they blow up near you ? Eli5 I woudn't think so , but i m not sure . Sorry for spelling Explain like I'm five. <>Yes . Although it 's generally less Hollywood style flying through the air and then dust yourself off and walk away and more roughly the same thing that happens to a person hit by a speeding bus .<>Yes, explosions can send you flying through the air in real life if they occur close to you. When an explosion occurs, it releases a tremendous amount of energy in the form of a shock wave. This shock wave can be powerful enough to lift a person off the ground and send them flying through the air. However, the distance a person is sent flying depends on the strength of the explosion and how close they are to the source of the explosion.<>reddit_eli5
