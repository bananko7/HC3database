Why is increased sucidal thoughts or actions always a side effect in antidepressants ? Seems counterproductive Explain like I'm five. 
To start , it 's not a common side effect . The first theory is that since antidepressants tend to resolve the physical symptoms of depression before emotional or cognitive symptoms , people suddenly have the energy to act on thoughts of suicide . The second is that it is simply a paradoxical reaction . For example , there is a small group of people who feel wired when they take medications that normally make people feel drowsy . No one is really sure why it happens . Brains are complicated , man . The third is that people already have thoughts of suicide and misattribute those thoughts to the medication rather than the reason they are taking antidepressants . The fourth is that people feel optimism that they are starting treating and become more depressed when treatment does n't work as well or as quickly as they expected . The problem with antidepressants is that they take weeks to really start working and they are not a cure - all . If some sort of external problem is impacting your mental health , medications ca n't make those problems go away . The efficacy rate of major antidepressants is in the 50 - 60 % range . Some people find the right drug on the first try , but many other people need several trials to find a medication that works for them . Bottom line : if you start to have thoughts of suicide after starting an antidepressant , talk to your doctor right away .
Antidepressants are medications that are used to treat depression, a common mental health condition that can cause people to feel sad, hopeless, and lose interest in things they used to enjoy. While antidepressants are generally effective at reducing symptoms of depression, they can sometimes have side effects, including an increase in suicidal thoughts or behaviors.\\n\\nIt's important to understand that antidepressants are not the cause of suicidal thoughts or behaviors. Instead, it's thought that the increase in suicidal thoughts or behaviors may be related to the underlying depression itself. When people are depressed, they may feel overwhelmed and hopeless, and they may have thoughts of suicide as a way to escape their feelings of despair. Antidepressants can help lift the mood of someone who is depressed, but they can also temporarily increase the intensity of these feelings, which can lead to an increase in suicidal thoughts or behaviors.\\n\\nIt's also important to note that not everyone who takes antidepressants will experience an increase in suicidal thoughts or behaviors. In fact, for many people, antidepressants can be life-saving medications that help them feel better and live more fulfilling lives. If you or someone you know is taking antidepressants and experiencing an increase in suicidal thoughts or behaviors, it's important to talk to a doctor or other healthcare professional right away. They can help determine the best course of treatment and provide support to help manage these side effects.
