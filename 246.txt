Lend money at a rate linked to the prime rate<>Yes.  In the US these are called certificates of deposit or savings accounts.  Every run-of-the-mill bank offers them.  You give the bank money and in return they pay you an interest rate that is some fraction of or (negative) offset from the returns they expect to make from your money. Since most investments that a bank makes (say, loaning money to a local business) are themselves based on some multiple of or (positive) offset from the prime rate, in return the interest rate that they offer you is also mathematically based on the prime rate. You can find lists of banks offering the best returns on CDs or savings accounts at sites like BankRate.<>The prime rate is a benchmark interest rate used by banks to set the rates they charge on loans to their most creditworthy customers, such as large corporations. It is based on the federal funds rate, which is the rate at which banks lend to each other overnight. The prime rate is typically a few percentage points higher than the federal funds rate.If you lend money at a rate linked to the prime rate, the interest rate on the loan will be based on the current prime rate, plus a certain margin. For example, if the prime rate is 3% and you lend money at a rate linked to the prime rate with a 2% margin, the interest rate on the loan would be 5%. If the prime rate increases to 4%, the interest rate on the loan would also increase to 6%.Lending money at a rate linked to the prime rate can be a good option for borrowers who want a variable interest rate that is tied to a widely-used benchmark. However, it can also be riskier for the lender, as the interest rate on the loan can fluctuate based on changes in the prime rate.<>finance
