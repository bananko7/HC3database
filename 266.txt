Why do creole languages always use phonetic spelling ? This is a pattern I 've noticed with every single creole I 've heard of . Is there something in the creole development process that leads to purely phonetic spelling ? Explain like I'm five. <>They use phonetic spelling because there is n't time for irregularities to arise . If you look at the complexities in English spelling , for example , most of them are either remnants of older English ( e.g. \" knight \" was originally pronounced as it was spelt ) or copied from other languages . Tracing back far enough , almost all irregularities arise this way ( though the occasional mistake is present ) . They are retained due to the influence of tradition and sense of social status they provided to the writing \" elite \" in times of lower literacy . In a creole , by contrast , these forces are not generally present . Given that most creoles emerged only in the past few centuries , pronounciation has not shifted sufficiently to override \" phonetic spelling \" . Compounding this is the fact that any such shifts would largely have been smoothed over- any \" social status \" to be sourced from writing is generally expressed through writing in the parent language(s ) of the creole .<>Creole languages are developed when people who speak different languages come together and need to communicate with one another. Since they don't all speak the same language, they need to find a way to make themselves understood. One way to do this is by using a common language that is made up of elements from each of the different languages. This common language is called a creole.\\n\\nOne characteristic of creole languages is that they often have a simpler grammar and vocabulary than other languages. This can make them easier to learn and understand, especially for people who are not native speakers of the languages that the creole is based on.\\n\\nOne reason that creole languages often have phonetic spelling is that the people who speak them are often trying to write down the sounds of the words as accurately as possible, so that others can understand what they are saying. In other languages, the spelling of a word may not always match the way it sounds, but in creole languages, the spelling is usually based on the way the word sounds. This can make it easier for people to learn how to read and write in a creole language, especially if they are not familiar with the languages that the creole is based on.\\n\\nOverall, the use of phonetic spelling in creole languages is a way to help people communicate and understand one another, despite speaking different languages.<>reddit_eli5
