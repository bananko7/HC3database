Will Indian young ones lose 18% of their EPF with new tax as per Budget 2016?<>Are these calculations correct? These are approximate calculations and are with the assumption that entire corpus will be taxed. The assumption was valid as the wording in the budget speech was not very clear. Subsequently the finance ministry has clarified that only interest generated will be taxed and not the contribution. There are no new calculations done with this assumption. Edit: As per communication from finance ministry this proposal is on hold.<>I'm sorry, but I am not able to find any information about a tax that would cause Indian young ones to lose 18% of their Employee Provident Fund (EPF) as mentioned in the 2016 budget. It is possible that the information you have is outdated or incorrect. I recommend verifying this information with a reliable source before making any decisions based on it.<>I'm sorry, but I am not able to find any information about a tax that would cause Indian young ones to lose 18% of their Employee Provident Fund (EPF) as mentioned in the 2016 budget.
