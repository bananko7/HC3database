Solo-401k interaction with employer sponsored 401k. Limits of contribution from Schedule C income<>Alright, team!   I found answers to part 1) and part 2) that I've quote below, but still need help with 3).  The facts in the article below seem to point to the ability for the LLC to contribute profit sharing of up to 25% of the wages it paid SE tax on.  What part of the SE tax is that?  I assume the spirit of the law is to only allow the 25% on the taxable portion of the income, but given that I would have crossed the SS portion of SE tax, I am not 100%.

Solo 401k contribution deadline rules dictate that plan   participant must formally elect to make an employee deferral   contribution by Dec. 31. However, the actual contribution can be made   up until the tax-filing deadline.  Pretax and\/or after-tax (Roth)   funds can be used to make employee deferral contributions. Profit Sharing Contribution A sole proprietorship may make annual profit-sharing contributions to   a Solo 401(k) plan on behalf of the business owner and spouse.   Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(3) states that employer   contributions are limited to 25 percent of the business entity’s   income subject to self-employment tax. Schedule C sole-proprietors   must base their maximum contribution on earned income, an additional   calculation that lowers their maximum contribution to 20 percent of   earned income. IRS Publication 560 contains a step-by-step worksheet   for this calculation. In general, compensation can be defined as your   net earnings from self-employment activity.  This definition takes   into account the following eligible tax deductions: (1) the deduction   for half of self-employment tax and (2) the deduction for   contributions on your behalf to the Solo 401(k) plan.  A business   entity’s Solo 401(k) contributions for profit sharing component must   be made by its tax-filing deadline. Single Member LLC Employee Deferral The owner of a single member LLC who is under the age of 50 may make   employee deferral contributions of as much as $17,500 to a Solo 401(k)   plan for 2013 (Those 50 and older can tack on a $5,500 annual catch-up   contribution, bringing their annual deferral contribution to as much   as $23,000). Solo 401k contribution deadline rules dictate that plan   participant must formally elect to make an employee deferral   contribution by Dec. 31. However, the actual contribution can be made   up until the tax-filing deadline.  Pretax and\/or after-tax (Roth)   funds can be used to make employee deferral contributions. Profit Sharing Contribution A single member LLC business may make annual profit-sharing   contributions to a Solo 401(k) plan on behalf of the business owner   and spouse. Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(3) states that   employer contributions are limited to 25 percent of the business   entity’s income subject to self-employment tax. Schedule C   sole-proprietors must base their maximum contribution on earned   income, an additional calculation that lowers their maximum   contribution to 20 percent of earned income.

It is similar to a traditional 401(k) plan, but it is tailored to the unique needs of self-employed individuals and small business owners.As a self-employed individual, you can contribute to a Solo 401(k) as both an employer and an employee. As an employer, you can contribute up to 25% of your net self-employment income, up to a maximum of $58,000 in 2021 (or $64,500 if you are age 50 or older). As an employee, you can contribute up to $19,500 in 2021 (or $26,000 if you are age 50 or older).If you are also participating in an employer-sponsored 401(k) plan, your total contributions to all 401(k) plans (including your Solo 401(k) and your employer-sponsored 401(k)) cannot exceed the annual contribution limit for 401(k) plans, which is $19,500 in 2021 (or $26,000 if you are age 50 or older). This limit applies to the total contributions made to all 401(k) plans in which you participate, regardless of whether they are made as an employee or as an employer.If you are self-employed and have income from a Schedule C business, you can contribute to a Solo 401(k) based on your net self-employment income from that business. However, you will need to consider the contribution limits for Solo 401(k) plans as well as the overall 401(k) contribution limits when determining how much you can contribute.It's important to note that the contribution limits for Solo 401(k) plans may be different from the limits for traditional 401(k) plans, so it's important to understand the rules that apply to your specific plan. If you have any questions about how much you can contribute to a Solo 401(k) or how it interacts with an employer-sponsored 401(k) plan, you should consult with a financial professional or a tax advisor.<>finance
