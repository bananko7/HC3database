Why does most garbage have the same smell ? My garbage and someone else 's can have almost the exact same smell , even if we have completely different items in our trash . What causes this ? Explain like I'm five. <>This is n't 100 % true as different garbage can smell different ( green waste vs solid waste , etc . ) But in normal trash , like you will have in a trash can on the street , the primary thing you 're smelling is decomposition of you 're food , mostly the protein like old bits of meat . The reason it all has a similar smell is they all produce pretty much the same gases , hydrogen sulfide , carbon dioxide , methane , and nitrogen . This is an extremely simplified way of putting it . But it 's one of the key factors .<>Most garbage has a similar smell because it is made up of a lot of the same kinds of things. For example, food waste, paper products, and yard waste can all contribute to the smell of garbage. These things can produce gases and liquids as they decompose, and these gases and liquids can create unpleasant odors. Even if two people's garbage is made up of different items, it can still have a similar smell if both people have a lot of these types of items in their trash. So, even though the items in the garbage may be different, the way they decompose can create similar smells.<>reddit_eli5
