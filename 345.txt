What the ruling on DOMA means for gay rights Apologies if this has already been posted but I could nt find it . So anyway , what will this ruling mean and what will change because of it ? Explain like I'm five.<>You 're the lucky first one ! Generally it means that if your state approves of your gay marriage the federal government must recognize it as well . This does n't mean gay marriage is legal everywhere , but it means gay marriage , where it 's legal , will be more equal than it was before this ruling .<>The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) was a federal law in the United States that defined marriage as a legal union between one man and one woman. It was enacted in 1996 and was later struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013 in a case called United States v. Windsor. Before DOMA was struck down, same-sex couples were not recognized as married by the federal government. This meant that they were not eligible for the same rights and benefits as opposite-sex couples, including things like the ability to file joint tax returns, receive spousal social security benefits, and have their spouse be eligible for health insurance through their employer. The Supreme Court's ruling on DOMA means that the federal government must now recognize same-sex marriages in the same way that it recognizes opposite-sex marriages. This means that same-sex couples are now eligible for the same rights and benefits as opposite-sex couples, including things like filing joint tax returns, receiving spousal social security benefits, and having their spouse be eligible for health insurance through their employer. In simple terms, the ruling on DOMA means that same-sex couples now have the same rights as opposite-sex couples under federal law. This is a big change because it means that same-sex couples are now treated equally under the law, which was not the case before the ruling.<>reddit_eli5
