How does the US grading system work ? I Do n't understand how it works and how much % each letter is . I 'm obviously talking about the grades in school . ( a+ a a- , b+ b b- ... ) Please explain :) Explain like I'm five.
I think it varies far too much to get any definitive answer , but as a rough guide : A+ generally does n't exist in the college level , but I guess it could be 97 - 100 . 94 - 100 - A 90 - 93 - A- 86 - 89 - B+ 83 - 85 - B 80 - 82 - B- 77 - 79 - C+ 74 - 76 - C 71 - 73 - C- 65 - 70 - D < 65 - F
In the United States, grades in school are usually given as letters, with A being the highest and F being the lowest. Here's how the grading scale usually works: A: 90% and above, B: 80% to 89%, C: 70% to 79%, D: 60% to 69%, F: Below 60%, Sometimes, schools will also use plus and minus signs to break up the grades a little further. For example: A+: 97% and above, A: 93% to 96%, A-: 90% to 92%, B+: 87% to 89%, B: 83% to 86%, B-: 80% to 82%, And so on. The exact percentages for each grade may vary slightly from school to school. So, if you get an A in a class, it means you did really well and scored in the top 10% of the class. If you get an F, it means you didn't do very well and scored below the bottom 60%. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
