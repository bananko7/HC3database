Why was gold ' unanimously ' chosen as currency and a representation of wealth ? Why not something essential like food ? EDIT : Keep in my food is an example , not a part of the overall question ! Explain like I'm five.<>Because food is perishable and is easy to produce . Mining new gold ( without expending more money than you 'd earn ) is pretty much out of the reach of most people .<>Gold has been used as a form of currency and a representation of wealth for many centuries because it has several properties that make it well-suited for this purpose.\r\n\r\nFirst, gold is abundant enough that it can be easily mined, but it is not so abundant that it loses value. This means that it can be traded for other goods and services without losing its value over time.\r\n\r\nSecond, gold is durable and does not corrode or tarnish. This means that it can be stored for long periods of time without degrading, making it a reliable store of value.\r\n\r\nThird, gold is easy to transport and divide into smaller units, making it convenient to use as a form of currency.\r\n\r\nFinally, gold has a long history of being used as a form of currency and a symbol of wealth, which has helped to establish its value and make it widely accepted.\r\n\r\nSo, while food is an essential good, it is not as well-suited as gold to be used as a form of currency because it spoils and is not as durable or convenient to transport and divide.<>reddit_eli5
