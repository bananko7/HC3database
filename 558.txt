How does it work if you live on the border of two time zones ? would n't living close to another timezone have potential to create problems ? Explain like I'm five.<>It creates some minor difficulties , but not as much as if you live on the border of a separate time zone that does not obey daylights saving time . The majority of Indiana used to not follow Daylights Saving Time . And the northern region is divided into two time zone . The region near Chicago is on Central , while the rest is on Eastern . Most of the region on Central followed DLST while the rest did not . Trying to remember times and arrive at places in other regions was fucking annoying .<>If you live on the border of two different time zones, it means that one part of your town or city follows one time zone, while the other part follows a different time zone. For example, if you live in a city that is on the border of the Eastern Time Zone and the Central Time Zone in the United States, one part of the city might follow Eastern Time (which is an hour ahead of Central Time) while the other part of the city follows Central Time. This can sometimes cause confusion or problems because different parts of the city might be on different times. For example, if it is 10:00 AM in the Eastern Time part of the city, it might be only 9:00 AM in the Central Time part of the city. This can cause problems with scheduling appointments or meetings, or with knowing what time it is when you are in a different part of the city. However, most people who live in border areas are used to this and know how to deal with it. They might set their clocks to the time zone that they are in most of the time, or they might use a special time zone converter to help them figure out what time it is in different parts of the city. Overall, living on the border of two time zones can be a little bit confusing at times, but most people are able to handle it without too much difficulty.<>reddit_eli5
