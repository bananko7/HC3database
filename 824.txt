how is the green monster legal in baseball rules ? How are the Red Sox able to just build a huge wall in the outfield so that it 's harder to hit home runs over it ? Why does n't every team just do this ? Please explain like I'm five.<>I 've always seen this as more of an obstacle for the Red Sox than an advantage . Nobody plays more games there than them , which means they have fewer opportunities to hit easy homers than any other team .<>The \"Green Monster\" is the nickname for the high left field wall at Fenway Park, the home stadium of the Boston Red Sox Major League Baseball team. The wall is called the \"Green Monster\" because it is painted green and is a towering obstacle for batters trying to hit home runs. In baseball, each team gets to decide the dimensions of their home field, including the height and shape of the outfield wall. The Red Sox have chosen to have a high wall in left field at Fenway Park, which makes it harder for batters to hit home runs over it. Other teams have chosen different dimensions for their fields, and some have much lower walls or no walls at all. It is allowed for teams to have different dimensions for their fields because it can create a unique home field advantage for each team. The Red Sox, for example, have an advantage at Fenway Park because the Green Monster makes it harder for opposing players to hit home runs. However, the Red Sox may have a disadvantage when they play on other teams' fields, where the walls may be lower or not present at all. Overall, the dimensions of a baseball field, including the height and shape of the outfield wall, are an important part of the game and can affect how teams play and score runs.<>reddit_eli5
