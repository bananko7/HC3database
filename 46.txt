What exactly does SAP ( software ) do for a company ? Why is this software so expensive and supposedly so hard to implement on a company ? Please explain like I'm five.
SAP is the most popular ERP ( Enterprise Resource Planning ) software package . It has modules that cover most of the computing needs of running a medium to large company - accounting , HR , manufacturing , inventory , sales and distribution , etc . It is viewed as difficult and costly to implement ( in my opinion ) because 1 ) most companies are trying to replace existing systems . You need to have a good understanding of all your business processes and the nuances . SAP has a ton of configuration options - which take time and money to set up . However , not all of a companys processes will directly translate . This means trade offs , somewhere 2 ) moving historical data from legacy systems to SAP is not trivial , due to the extensive data mapping required 3 ) consultants who know SAP configuration are n't cheap . 4 ) vendors like SAP and Oracle ( the database under some SAP implementations ) make money off their wares .
SAP is a type of business management software that helps companies organize and manage their data and processes. It can be used for tasks such as tracking sales and orders, managing inventory, and analyzing financial data. Many large companies use SAP because it is a comprehensive and powerful tool that can help them run their operations more efficiently. One reason SAP may be expensive is because it is a complex software with a lot of features and functionality. Implementing SAP in a company can also be a time-consuming and resource-intensive process, as it often requires customized configurations and integration with other systems. However, many companies feel that the benefits of using SAP, such as increased efficiency and improved decision-making, justify the costs.
