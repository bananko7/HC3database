Why are viruses not considered living organisms ? They seem like they would be their own kingdom . How are they not \" living \" ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Because they do n't reproduce themselves , they do n't have a metabolism , they do n't respond to stimuli and they 're basically just DNA \/ RNA wraped in a protective protein case .<>Viruses are not considered living organisms because they do not have all of the characteristics that are necessary for something to be considered alive. To be considered a living organism, something must be able to: 1. Grow and develop: Viruses do not have the ability to grow or develop on their own. They can only replicate (make copies of themselves) inside the cells of other living organisms. 2. Respond to stimuli: Living organisms can sense and respond to changes in their environment, such as light, temperature, or the presence of food. Viruses do not have the ability to sense or respond to stimuli. 3. Maintain homeostasis: Living organisms are able to maintain a stable internal environment, even when the external environment changes. Viruses do not have the ability to maintain homeostasis. 4. Evolve: Living organisms can evolve and change over time, adapting to their environment. Viruses do not evolve on their own, but they can evolve through the process of natural selection when they infect other living organisms. 5. Reproduce: Living organisms can reproduce and make new offspring. Viruses do not have the ability to reproduce on their own, but they can replicate inside the cells of other living organisms. Because viruses do not have all of these characteristics, they are not considered living organisms. Instead, they are classified as non-living particles that are capable of infecting and replicating inside the cells of other living organisms.<>reddit_eli5
