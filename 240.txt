Would occasional steroid use be harmful ? As someone who has never done weight training I 'm curious if occasionally using steroids would be overly harmful . Not talking about a competitive body builder however . Please explain like I'm five.<>As a general statement , yes . A medical professional would probably be able to control proper use of steroids , but that is n't you . Instead you are just trying to justify behavior which is likely to lead to steroid abuse .<>Steroids are a type of drug that can be used to treat a variety of medical conditions, but they can also have serious side effects when used improperly. Using steroids for non-medical reasons, such as to improve athletic performance or to enhance physical appearance, is not only illegal but can also be harmful. \nSome possible side effects of using steroids include: \nAcne and other skin problems\nHigh blood pressure and cholesterol\nLiver damage\nHeart problems, including an increased risk of heart attack and stroke\nShrinking of the testicles and reduced sperm count in men\nDeepening of the voice and growth of facial hair in women\nMood changes, including increased aggression (called \"roid rage\") \nSteroids can also be addictive and can cause withdrawal symptoms when someone stops using them. It's important to remember that there is no safe or effective way to use steroids without a prescription and medical supervision. If you are considering using steroids, it's important to talk to a doctor or other healthcare provider first to understand the risks and to determine if they are appropriate for you.<>reddit_eli5
