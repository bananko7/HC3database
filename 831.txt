what the phrase \" turtles all the way down \" means ? I read the Wikipedia article but .. I still do n't really get it . Explain like I'm five.<>It 's a joke . An old woman is convinced that the world sits on the back of a giant turtle . Underneath that turtle is another turtle , and so on . It 's turtles all the way down . It supposed to represent someone being presented with a gap in their beliefs and instead of questioning those beliefs , they double - down .<>\"Turtles all the way down\" is a saying that refers to the idea of an infinite regress, or an infinite series of events that keeps going forever. It comes from an old story that tries to explain how the world is supported.\n\nIn the story, someone asks how the world is supported, and someone else replies, \"It's supported by a giant turtle.\" But then the first person asks, \"What supports the turtle?\" and the second person says, \"It's supported by another turtle.\" And then the first person asks, \"What supports that turtle?\" and so on, with the answer always being that it is supported by another turtle.\n\nSo, the phrase \"turtles all the way down\" means that there is no end to the series of events or things that are supporting each other â€“ it just keeps going and going, like a never-ending chain of turtles. It's used to describe situations where it's difficult to understand or explain something, because there seem to be an infinite number of factors that are all connected and supporting each other.<>reddit_eli5
