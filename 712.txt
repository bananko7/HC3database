Why do you get \" stitches \" in your side after running I 'm talking about that pain in your obliques that you get after running . Explain like I'm five.<>The thoracic diaphragm is the major muscle involved in taking deep breaths . It attaches to the inside of the lower ribs and the oblique muscles . When in contracts it pulls the lungs down and pushes the liver and other organs down , too . Like any muscle it will ache after extended use if it is not used to working that hard for so long . The stitch you feel is just the diaphragm telling you it is getting tired and needs a breather , so to speak . The best way to avoid this is to train the diaphragm with breathing exercises and running within your limits which will increase as the muscle becomes more efficient .<>When you run, your body is working hard to move forward and keep you going. This can put a lot of strain on different parts of your body, including your obliques (the muscles on the sides of your waist). When these muscles are overworked, they can become sore and painful, which is what people refer to as \"stitches.\" Stitches can happen when you run too hard, too fast, or for too long, especially if you're not used to running or if you're not in good shape. They can also be caused by other factors, such as not breathing properly or eating too close to the time you run. To help prevent stitches, try to start running slowly and gradually build up your endurance, stretch before and after you run, and make sure you're hydrated and well-fed.<>reddit_eli5
