Why are Google , Microsoft , Yahoo , and Cisco all supporting CISPA when most of them vehemently opposed SOPA ? Source : URL_0 edit : Thanks for the response everyone ! Guess its true they 'd rather protect themselves than you , tough to blame them for that Explain like I'm five.<>Also , it gives them legal safe - harbors for giving your info to the government . Without CISPA , they were stuck in a nasty place between not appeasing government requests and some liability for not treating your information properly . Souce : various Techdirt articles . Warning : good blog , but they definitely have a point of view .<>The Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA) is a proposed law that was introduced in the United States Congress in 2011 and 2013. The main goal of CISPA was to allow companies and the government to share information about cyber threats, such as hacking attacks, in order to better protect against them. Many companies, including Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Cisco, supported CISPA because they believed it would help them protect their networks and customers from cyber threats.\n\nOn the other hand, the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) was a proposed law that was introduced in the United States Congress in 2011. The main goal of SOPA was to combat online piracy by giving the government and copyright holders more power to block access to or shut down websites that were alleged to be infringing on copyrights. Many companies, including Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Cisco, opposed SOPA because they believed it would harm the openness and innovation of the internet, and could potentially be used to censor legitimate websites.\n\nIn short, CISPA and SOPA are two very different pieces of legislation with different goals and implications. Companies may support or oppose different laws for different reasons, depending on how they believe those laws will affect their businesses and their customers.<>reddit_eli5
