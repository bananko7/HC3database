why the Oscar award for Best Director is for different movie than the one who won Best Movie ? Is nt it wierd ? Explain like I'm five.
The director is just one aspect of the movie . A very important one , but not everything . Imagine a movie is like a restaurant . The chef would be the director . A world class chef can make a restaurant into a wonderful experience . But , there 's more to it than that . There are things , many of which are outside the chef 's control that affect the success of the restaurant . Is the building in good repair ? Is it decorated well ? Is the wait staff well trained ? Is there sufficient marketing ? Is there a good wine selection ? You ca n't have a great reastaurant \/ movie without a great chef \/ director . But to be the very best , everything -- not just the kitchen -- has to be excellent .
