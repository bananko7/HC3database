How AI technology works in first \/ third person shooter videogames ? How do AI characters react to your moves in shooter videogames ? Also how do difficulty levels work for AI ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Valve has published a [ slide deck ( PDF ) ] ( URL_0 ) on how they designed the AI for Left 4 Dead . It 's a bit more on the technical side if that 's what you 're interested in . Difficulty levels are just based on how fast the AI reacts and how much error you allow it to have . It 's really easy to make the \" perfect \" AI because the computer always knows exactly where you are . So to make the game playable , you have to make the AI more stupid- it has to have some random error in its shots and you have to simulate some form of \" vision \" and reaction time or else the bad guys will just snipe you with a hitscan weapon from across the map as soon as the game starts . For a more difficult game , you just turn down the stupid factor .<>In a first- or third-person shooter video game, the AI characters are programmed to behave in certain ways and to react to the player's actions. For example, if the player is being stealthy and trying not to be seen, the AI characters might not notice the player and continue with their normal routines. But if the player is shooting and making a lot of noise, the AI characters might become alerted to the player's presence and try to find and attack the player. As for difficulty levels, they can affect how the AI characters behave in a few different ways. For example, on a lower difficulty level, the AI characters might be less accurate when shooting, or they might have less health so that they are easier to defeat. On a higher difficulty level, the AI characters might be more accurate and have more health, making them more challenging for the player to defeat.<>reddit_eli5
