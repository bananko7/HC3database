What separates the sky from space ? What 's to stop all our vital gasses such as oxygen to leak out into space . Are we in some sort of bubble so to speak ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Gravity keeps most of it hanging around , but some does get blown away by solar activity or whatever . I believe mars used to have a similar atmosphere but due to its lesser gravity it could n't hold onto it .<>The sky is the layer of the Earth's atmosphere that we can see. It's what we see when we look up and see the clouds and the sun and the stars. Space is everything beyond the Earth's atmosphere. There is no air in space, so there is no oxygen to leak out. The Earth's atmosphere is like a protective layer around the planet that keeps all of the air in. It's kind of like a bubble that surrounds the Earth and keeps everything inside.<>The sky is the layer of the Earth's atmosphere that we can see.
