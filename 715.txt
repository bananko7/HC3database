What is the rationale behind stock markets retreating due to S&P having a negative outlook on the USA?<>I think a big part of the issue is ignorance. For instance, the US govt cannot default on its loans, yet you keep hearing people speak as if it could. The US govt also does not have to borrow to pay for anything, it creates its own money whenever it wants. These 2 facts often evade many people, and they feel the US govt should act like a household, business, or a state govt. This disconnect leads to a lot of confusion, and things like \"fiscal crisis\". Just remember Rahm Emanuel - don't let a crisis go to waste.  Disclaimer: this is not to say the US should create money whenever it wants without thought. However, the simple fact is it can. For those interested in more, check out Modern Monetary Theory (MMT). Its economic study in a world not based on gold standard, or convertible currency (fiat currency).<>The Standard & Poor's (S&P) is a credit rating agency that evaluates the creditworthiness of governments, corporations, and other organizations. When S&P announces a negative outlook on a country, it means that the agency believes there is a higher risk that the country will default on its debt or that its creditworthiness will deteriorate in the future. This can be due to a variety of factors, such as a weak economy, high levels of debt, or political instability.If S&P announces a negative outlook on a country, it can affect the stock market by causing investors to become more risk-averse and sell off their holdings. This can lead to a drop in stock prices and a retreat in the stock market. This is because investors may perceive that the negative outlook on the country's creditworthiness creates additional risk for their investments, which could lead to lower returns or even losses.It's important to note that S&P's outlook is just one of many factors that can influence the stock market. Other factors, such as economic indicators, corporate earnings, and geopolitical events, can also impact stock prices.<>finance
