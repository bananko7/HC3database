Do Americans still need extra health care \/ medical insurance after reform to health care? [U.S.]<>I think it is too early to tell. They changed so many variables in an incredibly complex system, and a lot of it will depend on how the requirements in the legislation look once the bureaucrats and insurance companies get a chance to interpret them and implement them as policy. My gut feeling is that for most people, you should plan on some pretty price increases for insurance in the next few years as insurance companies try cover the costs of removing lifetime caps and insuring people with pre-existing conditions.

The bill includes almost a 4% increase in capital gains taxes.<>In the United States, it is still generally necessary for individuals to have some form of health insurance in order to cover the costs of medical care. The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, was a reform that aimed to increase access to health insurance and reduce the overall cost of health care. However, the law did not eliminate the need for individuals to have health insurance.Most Americans get their health insurance through their employer, but those who are self-employed or who do not have employer-sponsored coverage may need to purchase a private insurance plan. Some people may also be eligible for government-sponsored insurance programs, such as Medicaid or Medicare, depending on their income and other factors.It is important to have health insurance because medical care can be very expensive, especially in the event of an unexpected illness or injury. Without insurance, the costs of medical treatment can quickly become unaffordable, leading to financial hardship for individuals and families. Health insurance helps to protect against these costs by covering a portion of the expenses associated with medical care.In summary, while the Affordable Care Act has made it easier for many people to obtain health insurance, it is still necessary for most Americans to have some form of coverage in order to protect themselves and their families against the high costs of medical care.<>finance
