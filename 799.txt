Credit card expenses showing as Liabilities in QuickBooks<>Is it normal in QuickBooks to have credit card expenses being shows as   liabilities? Is there a way I can correct this? If they are expenses they shouldn't be negative liabilities unless you overpaid your credit card by that amount. It sounds like perhaps when you linked the account the credit\/debit mapping may have been mixed up. I've not used QB Online, but it looks like you might have to un-link the account, move all the existing transactions to 'excluded' and then link the account again and flip-flop the debit\/credit mapping from what it is now. Hopefully there's an easier way. This QB community thread seems to address the same issue.<>In QuickBooks, credit card expenses are typically recorded as liabilities.
