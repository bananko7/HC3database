What is a Reddit Shadowban , and how does it work ? I heard it brought up on a different sub and I 'm curious ! Explain like I'm five.<>A shadowban is when a bot is banned but is n't alerted of its \" bannedness \" so it keeps on doing what it 's doing , futilely because Reddit will balance out anything the bot does by performing the opposite action the bot has done . That is why you see the top posts with over ten thousand up votes and down votes . I used a bot in my example but it can apply to human users as well . An instance where this would be useful is when a troll is n't notified of his ban but keeps posting but will seemingly be ignored because no one can see his post .<>A Reddit shadowban is a way for Reddit to ban someone from the site without them realizing it. When a user is shadowbanned, their account and their posts will not be visible to anyone else on the site.\r\n\r\nHere's how it works: When a user is shadowbanned, their account is still technically active and they can still log in and use the site as usual. However, their posts and comments will not be visible to anyone else on the site. This means that other users will not be able to see their posts or comments, even if they try to search for them. The user will not receive any notifications or alerts to let them know that they have been shadowbanned.\r\n\r\nShadowbanning is typically used as a way to punish users who have violated the Reddit rules or policies. It is meant to be a way for Reddit to enforce its rules without outright banning a user from the site. However, some users have claimed that they have been shadowbanned for no apparent reason, which has led to criticism of the practice.<>reddit_eli5
