Why are we taught to walk across the street ? Surely it 's safer to run ? After having looked both ways , surely we are equally aware of our surroundings whilst running , yet also less prone to being run over ? Please explain like I'm five.<>You 're more prone to tripping when running , which would leave you prone , which is more prone to being run over .<>It's important to be cautious when crossing the street, no matter how you do it. Walking across the street can be safer than running because it allows you to move at a steady pace and pay more attention to your surroundings. When you're running, you might be more focused on getting across the street quickly and might not be as aware of your surroundings. This could make it more difficult to notice oncoming traffic or other potential hazards. It's also easier for drivers to see you and predict your movements if you're walking rather than running. Finally, if you do happen to trip or fall while crossing the street, the consequences are likely to be less severe if you're walking rather than running.<>reddit_eli5
