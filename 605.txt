Why are most of the foods that taste good bad for you ? Junk food tastes good but is bad for you but vegetables that do n't really taste good are good for you ... why ? Explain like I'm five.<>You 're just viewing it from your perspective . To me , junk food is good but I 'd rather eat properly prepared broccoli . Try accustoming yourself to different foods and healthier foods and you 'll see that junk food does not always have the better taste .<>Well, foods that taste good are often high in sugar, salt, or fat, which can be unhealthy if we eat too much of them. These ingredients can make food taste delicious, but they can also be bad for our bodies if we eat them in large amounts. On the other hand, vegetables and other healthy foods might not taste as good, but they are full of nutrients that our bodies need to stay healthy. So, even though they might not taste as good as junk food, they are still very important for our bodies.<>reddit_eli5
