What is that noise your computer makes when it 's \" thinking \" ? It almost sounds like a crackling noise . It 's not the fans . Explain like I'm five.<>The hard drive spins , but that is not the crackling sound you hear . That sound comes from the hard drive moving the head back and forth along the platter . The head does n't actually touch the spinning platter , but the drive mechanism ( motors and belts ) are noisy .<>That noise is called \"coil whine\". It is a high-pitched noise that some computers make when they are working hard. It is caused by the electrical current passing through tiny coils of wire inside the computer. These coils of wire are called \"inductors\" and they help to regulate the flow of electricity in the computer. When the electrical current passes through the inductors, it can cause the wires to vibrate and make a noise. Some computers are more prone to coil whine than others, and it is usually more noticeable when the computer is under heavy load, like when it is running demanding tasks or playing games.<>That noise is called \"coil whine\".
