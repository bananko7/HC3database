Planes on fire ? If a plane is flying and caught fire would the wind smother the fire or make it larger ? Explain like I'm five.<>Potentially yes , if the fire starts on a wing where high wind velocity could blow the fire away . But given that fuel , especially airplane fuel , even at 30,000 feet at 700 mph , could potentially burn very efficiently in a small amount of space compared to regular ol' wood , more than likely the fire would remain internal within the panelling of the wing , or , God forbid , the fuselage ( where the passengers sit ) .<>,"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5"}
