will someone please\" dues ex machina \" I do n't understand that saying . Is it a reference ? Explain like I'm five.
In ancient Greek plays , tragedies often ended with a God descending from heaven ( lowered by a machine , of course ) and bringing closure to the plot . Hence the saying Deus ex Machina ( * or * * God from the machine * ) . It is usually used when someone or something out of the blue brings a storyline to an end which would not have been possible otherwise . Example : In the final matrix movie , Neo makes a pact with one of the machines to kill Agent Smith . Without the help from that machine , this would not have happened and nothing in the film up to that point indicates that such an event was even a possibility . Note that the thing interfering in the plot line does not have to be divine or a machine to be called a Deus ex Machina , it simply needs to bring about an improbable change in the story .
Deus ex machina is a Latin phrase that means \"god from the machine.\" It is often used to describe a plot device in literature, film, or other media where a seemingly unsolvable problem is suddenly and conveniently solved by the unexpected intervention of some new event, character, or object. In other words, it's a way of resolving a difficult situation or problem in a story by introducing something or someone unexpected to fix it. It's like when a character in a movie or book is stuck in a dangerous situation, and just when it seems like there's no hope of escape, a helicopter appears out of nowhere to save them. In literature and film, deus ex machina can be seen as a cheat or a lazy way of resolving a story's conflict, because it doesn't necessarily follow logically from the events that have come before. It can feel like a convenient way for the writer to get the characters out of trouble, rather than finding a more believable or satisfying solution.
