Why do cats do that thing where they cry to leave or come into the house , but once you open the door they change their mind ? Is there any scientific explanation that suggests why they may do that or are they just assholes ? Please explain like I'm five.
Maybe they just want some attention . They noticed that if they vocalize in certain spots someone will come soon .
Cats can be very unpredictable at times, and it's not always easy to understand what they are trying to communicate. It's possible that your cat is trying to tell you something specific when they cry at the door, but it's also possible that they are simply expressing their desire to go outside or come inside, and they change their mind once the door is opened because they become distracted by something else.One thing that might be happening is that your cat is responding to stimuli in their environment. For example, if they see a bird or another animal outside, they may want to go outside to explore or hunt. If they see something interesting inside, they may want to come inside to investigate.Another possibility is that your cat is simply trying to get your attention. Cats are social animals, and they often rely on their humans for affection and interaction. By crying at the door, your cat may be trying to get you to interact with them and provide them with some attention.It's also possible that your cat is experiencing some anxiety or stress, and crying at the door is a way for them to cope with this. Cats can become anxious for a variety of reasons, such as changes in their routine or environment, or conflicts with other pets. If you think your cat might be experiencing anxiety, it might be helpful to talk to your veterinarian or a feline behaviorist for advice on how to help your cat feel more comfortable and secure.
