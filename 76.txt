Why do some religions still condemn things that are now ' socially accepted ' ? Such as homosexuality Please explain like I'm five.
Religions condemn them because their texts and doctrines condemn them . Religion is not dictated by society , religion dictates to society . If \/ when society drifts away from religion religion does not change ( much ) to match it . In stead religion dwindles in power and is relegated to myth .
Religions are sets of beliefs and practices that are often based on the teachings of a person or group of people who lived a long time ago. Many religions have teachings that say certain things are right or wrong, and these teachings can be based on the beliefs and values of the people who founded the religion. Some religions believe that certain things, like homosexuality, go against the teachings of their religion and are therefore wrong.Even though some things may be accepted by society, some people who follow a certain religion may still believe that those things go against their religion's teachings and so they choose not to do them. It's important to remember that everyone has the right to their own beliefs and to follow the religion that they feel is right for them.
