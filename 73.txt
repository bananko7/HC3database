How can there be WiFi on an airplane ? I 'm taking a flight across the country , and my plane has WiFi . What kind of black magic is at work here ? Explain like I'm five.<>The earlier systems , like Boeing 's Conexxion , used a special kind of antenna called a phased - array antenna . That antenna sent radio signals to a satellite in orbit which was then sent back to earth to an ISP . Slow , but it kind of worked . You also needed an antenna dome added to the top of the plane . The newer systems , like Gogo , use cellular transmitters on the plane to talk to special towers on the ground . The towers are just like your 3G\/4 G towers but the signals point UP instead of down at the ground around them . Gogo is planning to add satellite transmitters later so they can handle overseas flights . Once the signal gets to the plane it 's sent to a normal wifi access point and access \/ billing is handled at the ISP .<>Wireless internet on an airplane works in a similar way to how it works on the ground. The airplane is equipped with a special antenna that can communicate with ground stations on the ground, just like your phone or computer has an antenna that can communicate with your WiFi router at home.\n\nWhen you use your phone or computer to connect to the internet on the airplane, it sends a signal to the airplane's antenna, which then sends the signal to a ground station on the ground. The ground station is connected to the internet, so it can send the signal to the website or service you are trying to access. The website or service then sends the information you requested back to the ground station, which sends it back to the airplane's antenna, and then back to your device.\n\nThis all happens very quickly, so it feels like you are just using the internet like you normally would, even though you are high up in the sky on an airplane!<>Wireless internet on an airplane works in a similar way to how it works on the ground.
