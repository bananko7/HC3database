How does Time Dilation work ? How is it that actual time elapsed for the same event can be different for different observers traveling at different speeds ? Explain like I'm five.<>The answer to this question is a bit complicated but can be understood by anyone . First you need a few assumptions : * The speed of light is the same for all reference frames . Another way of saying that is no matter what you are looking at you always measure the speed of light the same . * You are always not moving in your own reference frame . Another way of saying it is , if you are in a car looking out the window it means exactly the same thing to say \" you and the car are moving down the road \" and \" the road is moving below you . \" One more thing . You need to know how clocks work . Since the one thing that is always the same is the speed of light , the simplest clock is a light clock . It is a flashlight \/ sensor ( FS ) and a mirror ( _ ) FS _ _ The flashlight makes a flash of light . The light bounces off the mirror and then hits the sensor . That is one tick . Each second is just a certain number of ticks . FS || || _ || _ If you hold a clock and look at it you would see the light taking a path straight up and down . Now let 's think what someone else would see if they looked at your clock while you drive down the high way . The flashlight \/ sensor would n't be in the same place when they made the flash as when it bounced back so to them it would look more like this . car moving this way - > F S \\ \/ \\ \/ _ _ \\\/ _ _ Notice that instead of going straight up and down the light had to go diagonal . \\ is a longer path than | . Since the speed of light is always the same and the light when a longer distance , it must have taken more time . For the person looking at your light clock each tick takes a longer time . Their own clock records more ticks in a second then yours does . Now this does n't happen to you . You are always at rest in your frame so the light is still bouncing straight up and down for you . You have no reason to think that your clock is running slowly . In fact . If you look out the windows at the other person 's clock you see them standing on the side of the road moving backwards . Their clock runs slowly for exactly the same reason . Time goes slower for people outside of your own frame because light has to travel a longer distance .<>Time dilation is a phenomenon that happens when things are moving really fast. It means that time passes slower for the things that are moving fast, compared to how it passes for things that are not moving as fast. For example, if you are in a spaceship that is traveling really fast, and you look at your watch, you might notice that time seems to be passing slower for you than it does for your friends who are on Earth. This is because the spaceship is moving really fast, and time passes slower for things that are moving fast. Does that make sense?<>reddit_eli5
