Why does China see an anti missile system in south korea as a potential threat to the national security ? Such an anti missile system is only capabel of destroying missiles right ? So why would it be considered as a threat to their security ? Explain like I'm five. <>Aight , so imagine you and your neighbour do n't like each other . You 're not actively fighting , but you 'd prefer if he went away . The reason you are n't fighting is that both of you can destroy the others house with a press of a button , but pressing that button you know your neighbour will also press his button , and then you both will lose your house . Suddenly , your neighbour puts down a machine that prevents your button from working . Now your neighbour can destroy your house without you being able to threaten him with anything<>Sure! An anti-missile system is a type of military technology that is designed to detect, track, and intercept missiles or other kinds of threats, such as aircraft or drones. These systems use radar and other sensors to locate incoming missiles, and then use specialized weapons to destroy or deflect them.\\n\\nNow, China might see an anti-missile system in South Korea as a potential threat for a few reasons. One reason could be that China is concerned about the military balance in the region. If South Korea has an advanced anti-missile system, it might give them an advantage in a potential conflict. This could make China feel less secure, especially if the system is capable of intercepting Chinese missiles.\\n\\nAnother reason could be that China is worried about the political implications of having an anti-missile system in South Korea. For example, if South Korea has an anti-missile system, it might be seen as aligning more closely with the United States, which could lead to tensions between China and South Korea.\\n\\nFinally, it's possible that China is concerned about the technology behind the anti-missile system. If the system uses advanced radar or other sensors, China might be worried about the potential for espionage or other kinds of technological theft.\\n\\nI hope this helps to explain the situation! Let me know if you have any other questions.<>reddit_eli5
