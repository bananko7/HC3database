What exactly does DirectX do ? And why do I need to update it for every new game ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Every game has graphics . Graphics are written in complex languages and are unique to every game . DirectX is basically a translator for your graphics card driver . However sometimes people add new libraries , change some old ones , or code their game differently . So when this happens , DirectX is updated to include these new libraries , so that your game runs smoothly . It 's unique in that while DirectX is a standard , you can add exceptions to the standard and have a unique way of coding your graphics .<>DirectX is a set of technologies that are used to help make it possible for programs, especially games, to work on your computer. It helps these programs use the graphics, sound, and other features on your computer more efficiently. When new games come out, they often need newer versions of DirectX to work correctly. This is because the games are designed to use the newer features and capabilities that are available in the newer versions of DirectX. If you don't have the latest version of DirectX installed on your computer, the game might not work correctly or might not work at all. That's why it's important to update DirectX whenever you install a new game.<>reddit_eli5
