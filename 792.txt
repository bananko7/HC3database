Why was a city like New Orleans built ... ... below sea level ? Did city planners assume that the levys would always hold ? Why put so many people in such danger ? Explain like I'm five.<>It was n't really planned . It was just a bunch of French settlers , I believe , who chose the area because it looked legit . It ballooned in size , and suddenly city planners realized that the whole area was n't such a great place to build a metropolis in after all . They built levies which could withstand crazy pressure and force . Just not , you know , a Category 5 hurricane 's storm surge kind of force -- no one expected that it was going to be that strong .<>New Orleans was built below sea level because it is located in a natural bowl-shaped depression in the land, with the Mississippi River to the south and Lake Pontchartrain to the north. The city is also surrounded by a network of levees, which are walls built to keep water out of the city.\r\n\r\nWhen the city was founded in the 18th century, the levees were constructed to protect it from flooding caused by the Mississippi River. The river has a tendency to overflow its banks during heavy rain or when there is a lot of snow melting in the north, and the levees were designed to keep the water from flooding the city.\r\n\r\nHowever, the levees were not built to withstand a major hurricane, like Hurricane Katrina in 2005. When a hurricane like that hits, the wind and waves can cause the water to rise very high, and the levees may not be able to hold it back. This can lead to flooding in the city, which can be very dangerous for the people who live there.\r\n\r\nSo, while the city planners did try to protect the city from flooding, they did not fully anticipate the risks of living below sea level. It is important for people who live in areas like New Orleans to be prepared for natural disasters and to have evacuation plans in place in case of emergencies.<>reddit_eli5
