How do buffets make profit ? Every time I go to a buffet , I always eat the expensive shit . It just baffles me how they make profit , because I 'm always 98 % sure I just ate more than I paid them . Explain like I'm five.<>If you buy in bulk , raw ingredients are * insanely * cheap . Buffets are profitable specifically because everyone is 98 % sure they ate more than you paid them ; unless it 's a very high quality buffet , there probably is n't anything you * could * eat enough of to manage that .<>Buffets make profit by charging a flat fee for all-you-can-eat access to a selection of food. They are able to offer this service at a lower cost than if you were to order individual items off a menu because they are able to purchase food in bulk and prepare it in large quantities. Additionally, buffets often have a mix of less expensive and more expensive items, so even if you do eat a lot of the more expensive items, the overall cost to the buffet is still lower than it would be if you had ordered those items individually. Finally, buffets rely on the fact that not everyone will eat as much as you do, so the average cost per customer is lower than the price of the buffet.<>reddit_eli5
