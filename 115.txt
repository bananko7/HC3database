God Vs . Allah God from the Christian Bible vs. Allah from the Qur'an . What are the differences , similarities ? Explain like I'm five.<>Same god ( mostly ) , just different translations of the word . Allah literally means \" the God \" in Arabic . Also Christians believe in something called the [ Holy Trinity ] ( URL_0 ) . This means that Gos is composed of three entities : the Father ( God ) , the Son ( Jesus ) , and the Holy Spirit . However it is still one deity . Islam , on the other hand , believes that God is the only deity and is only made of one part .<>God and Allah are believed by some to be the same higher power or divine being. In the Christian faith, God is believed to be the creator of the universe and the ultimate being of worship. In the Islamic faith, Allah is believed to be the one true God and the creator of the universe. One main difference between the two is that Christians believe that God is a trinity, made up of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, while Muslims believe that Allah is a singular being. Christians also believe that Jesus is the son of God and that he came to Earth to save humanity from sin, while Muslims do not believe this and view Jesus as a prophet but not the son of God. However, both God and Allah are believed to be all-powerful, all-knowing, and merciful. Both religions also teach that their respective divine being is loving and desires for people to live good, moral lives and to treat others with kindness and respect. Overall, while there are some differences in the beliefs about God and Allah held by Christians and Muslims, both faiths teach that their respective divine being is the creator and protector of the universe and desires for people to lead good lives.<>reddit_eli5
