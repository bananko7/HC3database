Why is lead used to protect against radiation ? Is lead the only metal that can stop gamma rays ? Why is it so commonly used when it ’s toxic itself ? Explain like I'm five. <>Because it is dense . Lead is n’t the only thing that can be used . To protect yourself against gamma radiation you want to put a lot of electrons in between yourself and the radiation source , and this is best done by putting something dense between them . You could just as well have massive walls of wood to achieve the same effect , but lead walls would be thinner and easier to handle as a result of their density . Ironically enough , this also means Uranium is a better shield against gamma radiation ( while Uranium does produce alpha radiation , it produces pretty much no gamma radiation , alpha radiation can be stopped by a piece of paper ) . Lead of course is far cheaper but sometimes Uranium is the better choice .<>Lead is a heavy metal that is very good at absorbing radiation. It can block certain types of radiation, such as alpha and beta particles, and it can also absorb and block x-rays and gamma rays. This is why lead is often used to protect against radiation, for example in lead-lined walls or lead aprons that are worn by people who work with x-rays.\\n\\nLead is not the only metal that can block radiation. Other heavy metals, such as tungsten and uranium, can also absorb radiation. However, lead is more common and less expensive than these other metals, which is why it is often used.\\n\\nLead is toxic to humans because it can harm the brain and other organs if it is ingested or inhaled. However, when it is used to block radiation, it is usually in a solid form that is not easily ingested or inhaled. This means that it can be used safely to protect against radiation as long as proper precautions are taken.<>reddit_eli5
