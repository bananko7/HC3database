I understand your concern and would explain that your symptoms could be related to bulging discs in the vertebral column. For this reason, I recommend consulting with a neurologist for a physical exam and some tests ( complete blood count, a lumbar column MRI study, blood electrolytes, vitamin D plasma levels for possible deficiency). Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.<>There are many potential causes of lower back pain and tingling sensations in the back and legs. Some common causes include muscle strains or sprains, nerve impingement or irritation, and problems with the bones or joints in the spine. Other potential causes may include spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal), degenerative disc disease, and spinal infections or tumors.\n\nIt is also possible that the pain and tingling sensation you are experiencing could be related to other medical conditions, such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis, or a vitamin deficiency.\n\nIt is important to see a doctor or other healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. They will be able to assess your symptoms and medical history, and may recommend further testing, such as an MRI or CT scan, to determine the cause of your pain and tingling sensation. Treatment may include medications, physical therapy, and lifestyle changes, such as exercising and maintaining good posture. In some cases, surgery may be necessary.<>medicine
