Seeing through a mantis shrimps eyes . I am just having a hard time understanding what vision would be like if we had 16 different types color cones . Explain like I'm five. <>One plausible explanation I heard was that the mantis shrimp brain ca n't combine and interpret colors the way that our brains do , and it was easier for them to develop more cones rather than develop that ability . While we can combine data from our red and blue cones to determine that the balloon is purple , they might need a purple cone for that purpose .<>Sure! Imagine that you have a box with 16 different colored markers in it. Each of these markers represents one of the color cones in the eyes of a mantis shrimp. When you look at something, your brain uses all of these markers to create a picture of what you're seeing.\\n\\nNow, let's say you see a red apple. To create the picture of the red apple in your mind, your brain would use the red marker in your box of markers. But if you were a mantis shrimp, you could also use markers for other colors, like orange or pink, to create a more detailed and accurate picture of the apple.\\n\\nSo having 16 different color cones in your eyes would allow you to see a lot more colors and shades than you would be able to with just a few color cones. It would be like having a box of markers with 16 different shades of red, instead of just one. This would give you a much more detailed and accurate picture of the world around you. Does that make sense?<>reddit_eli5
