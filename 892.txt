What causes wind ? What makes it stronger or weaker ? And how does it change direction ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Do you know how when you walk into a hot room ? That rush of air that shoots out the door into the cooler outside of the room . Basically that wind ( all wind ) is created because the hot air particles are moving much faster than the others and therefore need more volume to contain them . When you open the door those hot atoms and molecules are like \" fuck it 's hot get me out of that room \" and rush out into the cold . Fluctuations in pressure and the coreolis effect causes the cold fronts ( low pressure ) and hot fronts ( high pressure ) to swirl and change directions .<>Wind is caused by differences in air pressure. When the air pressure is higher in one place than it is in another, the air will try to move from the area where the pressure is higher to the area where the pressure is lower. This movement of air is what we feel as wind. The strength of the wind is determined by how big the difference is in air pressure between two places. The bigger the difference, the stronger the wind will be. The direction of the wind is determined by the way that the air is moving. If the air is moving from the north to the south, then the wind is coming from the north and blowing towards the south. If the air is moving from the east to the west, then the wind is coming from the east and blowing towards the west. Does that make sense? Do you have any more questions about wind?<>reddit_eli5
