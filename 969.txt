How can global warming be conclusively blamed on humans when there were multiple ice ages and Earth temperature fluctuations over the course of the Earth 's history ? This is a genuine request for knowledge . Please do n't bite . Please explain like I'm five.<>Changes in the climate is natural like you said . So for example are the extinction of animal species . Both of these will take place regardless of humanity , but human action has dramatically sped both up .<>It's true that the Earth's climate has changed over time, and there have been periods of warming and cooling in the past. However, the current warming trend is happening much more quickly than past climate changes, and it is primarily caused by human activities. One way to understand this is to think about the way that heat is trapped in the Earth's atmosphere. The Earth's atmosphere is made up of gases that trap heat from the sun, which helps keep the planet warm. Some of these gases, like carbon dioxide and methane, are called \"greenhouse gases\" because they trap heat in the same way that a greenhouse traps heat. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas, and cutting down forests, have caused the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to increase. This extra heat-trapping gases are causing the Earth's temperature to rise, leading to the current warming trend that we are seeing. On the other hand, the ice ages and other periods of cooling in the past were caused by natural factors, such as changes in the Earth's orbit and the amount of volcanic activity. These factors can still influence the Earth's climate today, but the main driver of the current warming trend is human activity.<>reddit_eli5
