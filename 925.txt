Where does electricity go ? For example , if I 've got a laptop and the electricity goes into it , where does it go ... O.o Explain like I'm five.<>Electricity is the * flow * of electrons . We either get energy from that flow ( with DC current ) or from the back and forth motion ( for AC current ) . The electricity typically flows in a loop ... a * circuit * . If you pick a point in the circuit , for every electron entering , another one is leaving . None gained , none lost . Just a flow . Think of it like the flow of water in a system of pipes with no outlets . Water just gets pumped around , but never is gained or lost . * * TL;DR * * - No electrons were harmed in the making of this post .<>,"index":null,"source":"reddit_eli5"}
