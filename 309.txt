Please help thanks<>Dear friend,As per your detail, you have neck swelling and chest swelling. if i am treating doctor, then i would like to examine the swelling first. Diagnosis can confirmed after examination only. A neck lump may be a lymphnode swelling and other swelling on chest me be lipoma or other cyst like sebaceous cyst. Lymphnode sweliing may subside itself, but lipoma or sebaceous cyst needs excision.Thank You.<>It is not possible for me to diagnose the cause of the lumps you are describing or recommend a treatment without more information and a physical examination. It is important to see a doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment.\n\nThere are many different types of lumps that can occur in the neck, chest, and back, and they can have a variety of causes. Some lumps may be benign (non-cancerous), while others may be malignant (cancerous). Only a doctor can determine the cause of the lumps and recommend the appropriate treatment.\n\nIf you are concerned about the lumps you are describing, it is important to see a doctor as soon as possible. The doctor will perform a physical examination and may recommend additional tests, such as a biopsy (a procedure in which a small sample of tissue is taken and examined under a microscope), to determine the cause of the lumps.\n\nIt is important to note that it is not uncommon for people to have small, benign lumps in their neck, chest, or back. However, it is always important to have any new or unexplained lumps checked by a doctor.<>medicine
