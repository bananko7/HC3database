Why does pouring water on grease fire increase the amount of flames ? I 've always wondered why water ; something that is used to put out fires increase the fire flames when added into grease fire . Explain like I'm five.<>Grease is an oil , it 's a liquid at burning temperatures . Oil and water do n't mix , so when you squirt water on grease you get balls of water in oil and vice versa . The balls of water in oil are a big problem . The oil is over 212˚F ( 100˚C ) so the water boils into steam . The steam expands , spreading the oil into a big , thin sheet , before it pops . Now you have a big , thin sheet of burning oil and the pop sends it flying through the air . Super - bad .<>\\nPouring water on a grease fire can actually make the fire worse because water and grease don't mix. When you pour water on a grease fire, the water sinks to the bottom of the pan and comes into contact with the hot grease. This causes the water to vaporize, or turn into steam, very quickly. The steam can cause the hot grease to splatter and spread the fire, which can make it bigger and more dangerous.\\n\\nIt's important to remember that water should never be used to try to extinguish a grease fire. If you have a grease fire in your kitchen, the best thing to do is to turn off the heat source and cover the pan with a metal lid or a baking sheet to smother the flames. If the fire is too big to control, you should leave the house and call the fire department.\\n\\n\\n\\n<>reddit_eli5
