Why is my lane always the slowest on the highway ? No comments about luck please ... Explain like I'm five.<>[ ok not luck ] ( URL_0 ) It 's called confirmation bias . Because you put more emphasis on noticing when you 're in the slow lane you think you 're in the slow lane all the time which probobly is n't true . If you wanted to make the effort you could test it yourself . Define parameters for a fast \/ slow lane and see how long you 're in each . You 'd be surprised .<>There could be a number of reasons why your lane seems to be the slowest on the highway. Here are a few possible explanations:\r\n\r\nThere might be more cars in your lane than in the other lanes. If there are more cars in your lane, it will naturally be slower because there is less space for each car to move.\r\n\r\nYour lane might have more trucks or other large vehicles in it. These types of vehicles tend to be slower and can hold up traffic in their lane.\r\n\r\nThere could be an accident or construction in your lane. If there is an obstacle in your lane that is blocking traffic, it will naturally be slower.\r\n\r\nFinally, it's possible that your lane is just naturally slower for some reason that you don't know about. There could be a difference in the road surface, the slope of the road, or something else that is causing your lane to be slower.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the reason, it's important to remember that driving on the highway can be unpredictable and there will always be times when traffic moves more slowly in certain lanes. It's best to stay calm and patient, and try to enjoy the ride as much as possible.<>reddit_eli5
