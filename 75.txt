How can banks afford to offer credit card rewards?<>Michael Pryor's answer is accurate to the actual question asked. The current accepted answer from Dheer is not entirely true but roughly provides an overview of the different entities involved in a typical transaction, with some wrong terminologies, corrected and improved below.  The issuing bank, the one that issues the credit card to the customer. When it comes to the service fee split, the issuer bank takes on the majority of the cut in the service fee paid by the merchant to the different entities. For example, on a 2.5% overall fee paid by merchant, roughly 1.5% goes to the issuer, 0.3% goes to the card network (visa, master card, etc) and the remaining 0.7% goes to the acquiring bank. Reward programs have a partnership with participating merchants, where merchants are charged a higher service fee, for the likelihood of driving a higher volume of transactions to the merchant. A portion of the rewards also comes from the issuer, who shares a percentage of their fee back to the customer, in exchange for the same likelihood of making more profit through increased volume in total transactions. For example, a reward program may charge merchants 4.5% fee, with 3.5% of it going to the issuer. Upto 3% of this can be given back to the customer for their loyalty in using the card service. The banks can afford to take as little as 0.5% instead of their regular 1.5% due to the increased volume of transactions and the fixed fee they collect as membership fee. Note that costco has a similar business plan, but they make money entirely of membership fee. So with enough clients, banks can theoretically afford to run their program entirely on membership fees, costing no additional service fee to merchants. The service fee depicted above is arbitrary, and it can be lowered if the merchant is also a client of the issuing bank, that is, both the issuing bank and acquiring bank are the same. So it is kind of a win-win-win situation. And as usual, the banks can afford to make a larger income, if the customer ends up paying interest for their credit - although the rewards program is not designed accounting on this.<>Banks are able to offer credit card rewards programs because they make money from the fees they charge merchants for processing credit card transactions, as well as from the interest they charge cardholders on unpaid balances. They also make money from the annual fees that some credit cards charge.When a cardholder uses a credit card to make a purchase, the merchant pays a fee to the bank that issued the card. This fee is typically a percentage of the purchase price and is known as the merchant discount rate. The bank uses some of this money to cover its costs and to make a profit, and it uses some of it to fund the rewards program.The bank also makes money from the interest it charges on unpaid balances. If a cardholder doesn't pay off their balance in full each month, the bank charges interest on the unpaid amount. The interest rate is typically quite high, and it can add up quickly if the cardholder carries a large balance.In addition to these sources of revenue, some credit cards charge an annual fee to cardholders. This fee is usually a fixed amount that is charged to the cardholder's account each year.Overall, the combination of these sources of revenue allows banks to offer credit card rewards programs while still making a profit.<>finance
