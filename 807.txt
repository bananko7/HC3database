USING avogadro 's number and converting between mass , mole , molecule etc . I am having a terrible time with this and could use some help . Thanks Reddit . Explain like I'm five.<>Avogadro 's number = 6.02E23 = ATOMS \/ MOLE If you take the molecular mass of any element ( GRAMS \/ MOLE ) , rearrange and substitute , you can find how many atoms you have or how much a number of atoms weighs . Examples : If I have 10.0 g of [ Copper ] ( URL_0 ) , atomic mass 63.546 , how many atoms do I have in my baby - ingot ? MOLECULAR WEIGHT = GRAMS \/ MOLES 63.546(g \/ mol ) = 10.0(g ) \/ MOLES MOLES = 10.0(g ) \/ 63.546(g \/ mol ) MOLES = 0.157 ... Therefore using our handy Avogadro 's number we can plug that in : 6.02E23 = ATOMS \/ MOLE 6.02E23 = ATOMS \/ 0.157 ... 6.02E23 * 0.157 ... = ATOMS 9.47 ... E22 = ATOMS Therefore we know there are 94,734,523,000,000,000,000,000 atoms of Copper in 10.0 g ( rough enough ) . This works with ANYTHING . Water has been mentioned , as we all know it 's H20 , molecular mass 2 x Hydrogen + 1 x Oxygen . METH is C10H15N , so for homework , how many molecules does the junkie get with his gram ? I 'll bet his dollars \/ molecule is pretty low ! EDIT : I should add that a Mole is basically a totally made up unit , and really corresponds only to the number of Hydrogen atoms in 1 gram .<>Sure! I'd be happy to help.\n\nAvogadro's number is a very important concept in chemistry. It is a number that tells us how many atoms or molecules are in a certain amount of a substance.\n\nFor example, let's say we have a substance called \"sugar.\" If we have one mole of sugar, that means we have 6.022 x 10^23 molecules of sugar. This number is known as Avogadro's number, and it is the same for any substance.\n\nSo, if we want to convert between mass, mole, and molecule, we can use Avogadro's number to help us.\n\nFor example, let's say we have 10 grams of sugar. We can use Avogadro's number to convert this to moles by dividing the mass by the molecular weight of the sugar. The molecular weight of sugar is 342.3 g\/mol, so 10 grams of sugar is equal to 0.0292 moles of sugar.\n\nWe can also use Avogadro's number to convert from moles to molecules. If we have 0.0292 moles of sugar, that is equal to 6.022 x 10^23 x 0.0292 = 1.75 x 10^22 molecules of sugar.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.<>reddit_eli5
