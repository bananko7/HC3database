Is the money you get from shorting a stock free to use for going long on other stocks?<>You sold $10,000 worth of stock so that money is essentially yours.  However, you sold this stock without actually owning any which means that you, through your broker, are currently borrowing shares amounting to (at the time of your sale) $10,000 from someone who actually owns this stock. You will be paying this person interest for the privilege of borrowing their shares, the exact amount charged varies wildly and depends on factors such as short interest in the stock (loads of people want to go short = shareholders can charge high interest) etc. If I remember correctly hovering over the \"position\" column in your portfolio in the IB Workstation should give you information about the interest rate charged.  You will have to buy back these shares from the lender at some point which is why the $10k isn't just \"free money.\" If the stock has gone up in price in the meantime you are going to be paying more than the $10k you got for the same amount of shares and vice versa.<>Yes, when you short a stock, you borrow shares of the stock from someone else and sell them on the market. If the price of the stock declines, you can then buy the shares back at a lower price and return them to the person you borrowed them from, pocketing the difference as profit. The money you receive from shorting a stock can be used to buy other stocks, or it can be used for any other purpose. However, it's important to note that shorting a stock carries risks and is not suitable for all investors. There is the potential for unlimited losses if the price of the stock you are shorting goes up instead of down. It is important to carefully consider the potential risks and rewards of any investment strategy before taking action.","When you sell a stock \"short,\" you are essentially borrowing shares of the stock from someone else, selling them on the market, and hoping the price will go down. If the price does go down, you can then buy the shares back at the lower price, return them to the person you borrowed them from, and pocket the difference as profit. The money you make from shorting a stock is not \"free\" in the sense that it doesn't come without risk or cost. However, you can use the profits from shorting a stock to buy other stocks if you choose to do so.It's important to note that short selling is a highly speculative and risky strategy, and it can result in significant losses if the stock price goes up instead of down.
