Why does HTML5 use little internet data than GIFs ? I also see that html5 is much faster and looks better than GIFs , why is nt the GIF obsolete and used side by side with html5 ? Please explain like I'm five.<>GIF is n't obsolete because HTML5 is n't one format whereas .gif is . HTML5 is simply a way of embedding H.264 , MPEG-4 , or WebM format video files ( that can potentially contain audio ) in a webpage . Which one you get depends on your browser and what the website is ready to serve you , this is what Imgur 's .gifv pseudo - extension does , it hides the specific video format from the user and serves up the correct one for your browser . .gif on the other hand is always the same , and all browsers support it . The guaranteed lack of audio is also a selling point for some in addition to the universal compatibility .<>HTML5 is a markup language that is used to structure and format content on the web, while GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) is a file format for image files that supports short, low-resolution animations. HTML5 and GIFs serve different purposes and are used for different types of content on the web. \nHTML5 is more efficient than GIFs in terms of data usage because it allows you to display images and other types of media directly in the HTML code, without having to use separate image files. This means that you can include images and other media on your web pages without adding extra data to your website. In contrast, GIFs are separate image files that have to be downloaded separately from the HTML code, which can increase the amount of data needed to load a web page. \nHTML5 is also faster than GIFs because it allows you to display media directly in the HTML code, rather than having to load separate image files. This can make your web pages load faster, especially on devices with slower internet connections. \nOverall, HTML5 is a more efficient and flexible way to display media on the web compared to GIFs, which is why it is more widely used today. However, GIFs are still used for certain types of content, such as short animations and memes, because they are easy to create and share.<>reddit_eli5
