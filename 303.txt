Why can humans live longer now than we could , say , 500 years ago ? What changed ? Explain like I'm five.<>Humans * do n't * live longer than we did back then . * Life expectancy * is longer * on average * now , but that 's not the same thing as saying people can live longer now . Look at it this way . Imagine that most people who live to adulthood die at the age of seventy . It would be fair to say , then , that human beings can live about seventy years . Some longer , some less , but the limit to how long a person lives is * around * seventy years . But what if one person out of two dies in childhood ? In that case , the * average life expectancy * would only be about forty or so . Because half the population would die at a young age … even though everybody who * did n't * die at a young age would live to seventy years , plus or minus a couple . And that 's been the case pretty much throughout all of recorded history . A human being who * does n't die young * will live * approximately * seventy years . Plus or minus a bit . But over time , as societies have changed , it 's become less ( or in some cases , more ) likely for people to die for some reason before reaching their dotage . Infant mortality , dangerous lifestyles of the young and fit , et cetera , et cetera . This causes the * average life expectancy * to trend upward , as we get better and better , both individually and in social groups , of not dying young . Basically , the story of a human life is this : If * nothing kills you , * you 'll live to be * about * seventy years , give or take a bit . But if something kills you , you 'll die sooner than that . Over the course of recorded history , the overall trend has been toward * fewer * people being killed young … but the human lifespan is not significantly different from what it 's always been for as far back as people can remember .<>There are many factors that have contributed to people living longer today than they did in the past. One of the main reasons is that we have made tremendous progress in understanding and treating diseases. For example, we have developed vaccines to prevent many deadly infectious diseases and we have developed better treatments for diseases such as cancer and heart disease.\n\nIn addition, we have made improvements in our living conditions. For example, we have access to better food, clean water, and healthcare, which all contribute to our overall health and well-being.\n\nWe have also learned more about how to live healthy lifestyles, such as the importance of exercise, eating a healthy diet, and not smoking. All of these factors can help us live longer, healthier lives.<>reddit_eli5
