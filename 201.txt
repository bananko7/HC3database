There are many possible causes for these symptoms, and it's important to have your child evaluated by a doctor to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.\n\nSome possible causes of nosebleeds, headaches, and vomiting in children include:\n\nInfections, such as the common cold or flu\nAllergies\nSinusitis (inflammation of the sinuses)\nMigraines\nConcussion or other head injury\nHigh blood pressure\nMotion sickness\nFood poisoning\nIt's also possible that your child's symptoms could be caused by a more serious condition, such as a brain tumor or an aneurysm. That's why it's important to have your child evaluated by a doctor as soon as possible. The doctor will be able to perform a physical examination, order any necessary tests, and determine the cause of your child's symptoms. They may recommend treatment such as medications, lifestyle changes, or further testing or referral to a specialist.<>medicine
