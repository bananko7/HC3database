How do Mountains affect the weather ? I live along the western side of the Appalachian Mountains . Our weather seems to be so unpredictable . When reading forecasts , especially with winter weather , very rarely are the forecasts accurate . Just curious . Explain like I'm five. <>Air that used to be at sea level changes its thermodynamic properties at the top of the mountain . This changes , pressure , temperature and its speed . All have a factor on how much water the air contains or can hold . That is why it snows on top of mountains , because the water in the air comes out of solution and remains cold all year at high mountains because the air is colder intrinsically because of its elevation rise due to lower pressure . The pressure is lower because there is less weight of air pushing down above the air on the top of the mountain .<>Mountains can have a big impact on the weather because they affect the way that air moves. When air hits a mountain, it has to go up and over the mountain. This can cause the air to cool down and create clouds, which can lead to rain or snow.\\n\\nIn the winter, the cold air on the mountain can cause the air at the base of the mountain to be colder too. This can lead to cold and snowy weather in the area around the mountain.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the mountains can also block the movement of weather systems, so that the weather on one side of the mountain can be very different from the weather on the other side.\\n\\nOverall, the mountains can make the weather more unpredictable because they can cause big changes in the way that air moves and the temperature. That's why it can be hard to make accurate weather forecasts for areas near mountains.<>reddit_eli5
