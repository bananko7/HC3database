Are modern humans pure homo - sapiens ? Or are we a mix of Homo - sapiens , Denisovans , and other pre modern humans ? And can you explain the differences of them and when they went their separate ways to the different continent ? Please explain like I'm five.<>If you can trace your ancestry to somewhere other than Africa , you have trace Neanderthal DNA , up to 4 % by conservative estimates and 10 % by more extreme ones . We interbred with them after we left Africa , so therefore people who can trace themselves back to that continent would lack this admixture . You also mentioned Denisovans . Traces of their DNA have been found in some human populations as well .<>Modern humans, also known as Homo sapiens, are not a mix of different pre-modern human species. Rather, modern humans are the result of the evolution of Homo sapiens over the past 300,000 years or so.However, it is possible that modern humans have some genetic material inherited from other human species that lived in the past, such as the Denisovans, which were a group of ancient humans who lived in what is now Siberia. This is because there was some interbreeding between different human species in the past.Homo sapiens, Denisovans, and other pre-modern human species all evolved from a common ancestor and went their separate ways as they migrated to different parts of the world and evolved to suit the environments they lived in. For example, Homo sapiens evolved in Africa and then migrated to other parts of the world, while Denisovans evolved in Asia.Does this help answer your question?<>reddit_eli5
