Why do males and females typically throw things so differently with their dominant arm ? Is it just a trained skill ? A muscular difference ? Why do many women lob a baseball awkwardly while men throw with more control ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Three things here : 1 . This is n't always true , I 've seen girls throw balls just as well and with an identical ( so far as I could see ) technique . 2 . Men have naturally stronger upper bodies so we 're more naturally capable of throwing a ball further than a woman is 3 . Practice , boys are more likely to have practice throwing balls than girl are , so we can refine our technique better .<>There are a few reasons why males and females might throw things differently with their dominant arms. One reason is that men and women often have different levels of muscle mass and strength, which can affect their throwing motion. Additionally, people can throw differently depending on how they have learned to throw and what they have practiced. Some people may have learned to throw with more control, while others may have developed a more lobbing motion. Finally, there are some small differences in the way men and women's bodies are built that could also affect their throwing motion. For example, women tend to have less upper body strength than men, which could make it more difficult for them to throw with as much power and control.<>reddit_eli5
