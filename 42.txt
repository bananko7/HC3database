Why do languages vary so widely ? Is any proven correlation between language and the geography of the native speaker ? Why do we have such vastly alternative languages ? Does the geography of one 's birthplace have any part in the shaping of that person 's language ? Please explain like I'm five.
Because languages naturally change over time , and when groups of people are separated from each other , their languages diverge . So , for example , English immigrants went to what is now the USA speaking the same English as people in England . But over time the English spoken in England and that spoken in the USA diverged , so that now American English and British English accents are noticeably different . That change took 300 or 400 years . Now think of how much change could take place over much greater lengths of time- 800 years , 1000 years , 5000 , 10,000 , 60,000 , 100,000 years . In pre - modern times long - distance travel and communication was much more difficult than it is today . People in distant parts of the world had no contact with each other and their languages grew apart for thousands of years . That 's why there are so many different languages in the world today .
Languages vary widely because people who speak different languages often live in different places and have different histories and cultures. These differences can lead to changes in the way that language is used and spoken over time. There is a strong relationship between language and geography, as people who live in the same place often share a common language. This is because language is passed down from one generation to the next, and people who live in the same place are more likely to have shared experiences and cultural traditions that shape their language. There are many different factors that can influence the way that a language develops and changes over time. Some of these factors include the history and culture of the people who speak the language, the influences of other languages, and the physical environment in which the language is spoken. So, to answer your question, geography can play a role in shaping a person's language, but it is not the only factor. There are many other factors that can influence the way that a language is spoken and used.
