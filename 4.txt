Why are n't there any cross - country taxi services ? Need to travel , too poor for airfare . Thought long distance taxi may be more cost effective . After searching the web far and wide , it does n't seem to exist , though . Why ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Buses . Buses are as close as you 'll get . It 's because the cost in fuel alone would rival that of a plane ticket , but then there is the added cost of maintenance , the fact that you would need to stop for hours a day in order to keep driving straight because the cabbie would need to sleep . Not to mention the fact that few people want to be gone from their homes for days on end for work .<>Cross-country taxi services do exist, but they may not be as common as other forms of transportation such as buses or airplanes because they can be more expensive and may not be as convenient. Taxi services are usually used for short distances within a city or town, and are not typically designed to travel long distances. This is because taxis charge a fee for the distance traveled and the time spent on the road, so a long distance trip would be much more expensive than taking a bus or a plane. Additionally, buses and airplanes are often faster and more efficient ways to travel long distances because they can cover large distances in a shorter amount of time. They also typically offer more amenities and comforts, such as air conditioning and restrooms, which can make the journey more enjoyable. So, while cross-country taxi services do exist, they may not be the most cost-effective or convenient option for long distance travel.<>reddit_eli5
