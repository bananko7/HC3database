Why is there more diversity in hair \/ eye colour of caucasions compared to darker coloured people ? Why is it so uncommon for darker coloured people to have anything but brown hair \/ eyes and what varies when it comes to caucasion people ? Please explain like I'm five.<>ELI5 : People need different traits for different climates . The genetic mutations that made it possible for people to have lighter skin in colder areas with little light , made it more likely that genetic mutations would occur in other coloring ( such as hair and eye color ) . It was never beneficial for people in warmer \/ bright climates to have lighter skin , so they do not have the genetic mutations that make it possible for it to occur . In cases where a blond person has children with a brunette , the genes for darker coloring are dominate so the brown eyed \/ brown hair parent has a better chance of passing their coloring to their child . Since people with darker skin usually do n't have those light coloring mutated genes hanging around their gene pool , it makes it even more likely that light coloring wo n't occur .<>Hair and eye color are determined by genetics, which is the way that traits are passed down from parents to their children. Different traits, such as hair and eye color, are determined by different genes. There is more variation, or diversity, in the genes of some populations compared to others. For example, there is more variation in the genes that determine hair and eye color in people who are of European descent (also known as Caucasians) compared to people who are of African descent. This is why you might see more people with different hair and eye colors among people who are of European descent compared to people who are of African descent. It doesn't mean that people of African descent can't have different hair and eye colors, but it is less common because there is less variation in the genes that determine these traits in this population.<>reddit_eli5
