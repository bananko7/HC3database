Why is there a broad spectrum of people on juries , and not the defendant 's peers ? Would n't a jury of the defendant 's peers be the same race and gender , and be in a similar age group ? Please explain like I'm five.<>The statement \" jury of ones peers \" actually comes from the Magna Carta and not the constitution . The intent was that when someone committed a crime they would be tried by a jury of their social and economic peers , not racial or otherwise . That meant that a noble would be tried by a group of nobles , not commoners , and commoners would be tried be commoners , not nobles since there was a lot of resentment between groups . Nowadays , the phrase more commonly means that you will be tried by a jury of fellow citizens and has little to do with anything else . Since jury pools are randomly selected from all the citizens withing a given population , and can not be removed without a good reason ( well , technically they can in limited quantities by both sides via a peremptory challenge ) , they meet the requirements .<>A jury of the defendant's peers would not necessarily be the same race or gender as the defendant, or be in a similar age group. The purpose of having a diverse group of people on a jury is to ensure that the jury represents a fair cross-section of the community and can make a fair and unbiased decision based on the evidence presented in the case.Having a diverse group of people on the jury helps to ensure that different perspectives and life experiences are taken into account when considering the evidence and making a decision. It also helps to prevent biases or prejudices from influencing the jury's decision.Overall, the goal of the justice system is to ensure that all individuals receive a fair and impartial trial, and having a diverse jury helps to ensure that this goal is met.<>reddit_eli5
