Why do we take medication to lower fever \/ inflammation ? Our body uses these processes to fight against a bacterial infection for example . Why do we act against it ? Explain like I'm five. <>Two reasons . One , people do n't enjoy having fevers . They want to feel good , not sick , but they will settle for not having a fever even if it means they * might * be sick * slightly * longer ( though I do n't think in any significant way ) . Two , inflammation is not always a good thing . Often inflammatory processes might be activated inappropriately and can cause damage to your body on their own . There are all sorts of diseases which do that . However , I do n't think that 's what you 're asking about . Most people taking an anti - inflammatory do so for pain relief or to relieve discomfort from swelling . Some of the chemical signals used to activate the inflammatory response also are involved in pain transmission , both of which can be knocked out with anti - inflammatories . So in common terms , reason 2 is the same as 1 . TLDR : People want to feel better and in * many * cases it wo n't affect the outcome either way , so you might as well take them .<>Fever and inflammation are natural responses of the body to help fight off infections and other types of injuries. When the body is fighting an infection, it raises the body's temperature to help kill the bacteria or virus that is causing the infection. This is why you might have a fever when you are sick.\\n\\nInflammation is a process that helps the body repair itself after an injury or infection. It involves swelling and redness in the affected area, and it can also cause pain and discomfort.\\n\\nWhile fever and inflammation can be helpful in fighting off infections and injuries, sometimes they can become too severe and cause more harm than good. For example, a very high fever can be dangerous, and chronic inflammation can lead to long-term health problems. In these cases, it might be necessary to take medication to lower the fever and reduce the inflammation. This can help the body recover more quickly and prevent further harm.\\n\\nSo, in short, we take medication to lower fever and reduce inflammation because sometimes these natural processes can become too severe and cause harm to the body. By controlling the fever and inflammation, we can help the body fight off infections and injuries more effectively and recover more quickly.<>reddit_eli5
