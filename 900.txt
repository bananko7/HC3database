Why does acid+base make salt + water ? Ex . why ca n't HCl+NaOH remain where they were instead of dancing around and form the double displacement ( H2O+NaCl ) , are n't their charge already stable to remain where they were ? Please explain like I'm five.<>HCl and NaOH are both strong electrolytes ( meaning that they completely dissociate into ions when placed in water ) . This means that you do n't have HCl or NaOH in solution . You have H^+ , Cl^- , Na^+ and OH^- . When H^+ ions come into contact with OH^- ions , they form water . Since water is a very weak electrolyte ( only about 1 molecule in 10 million will dissociate ) , it stays in its liquid form . All of the other possible combinations of ions ( H and Cl , Na and OH , Na and Cl ) will not form in appreciable amounts because of how soluble they are . At the end , your solution is left as H2O , Na^+ and Cl^- .<>Acids and bases can react with each other because they both have a property called \"polarity.\" This means that the positive and negative charges in the compound are not evenly distributed. When an acid and base are mixed together, the positive and negative charges can be rearranged to create a new compound that has a more even distribution of charge, called a salt. The reason that the acid and base \"dance around\" and rearrange themselves is because this creates a more stable arrangement of positive and negative charges, which is more energetically favorable. The water and salt that are produced are just byproducts of this reaction. Hope that helps!<>reddit_eli5
