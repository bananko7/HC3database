Clouds are ice . Why are fair weather clouds white and storm clouds dark ? ELI5 : Clouds are ice . Why are fair weather clouds white and storm clouds dark ? What makes the ice turn to water and fall ? Explain like I'm five.<>All clouds are \" white \" , but from underneath , some clouds appear darker because less light comes through . This is because the clouds are denser .<>Clouds are made up of tiny water droplets or ice crystals that form in the Earth's atmosphere. These droplets or crystals are very small, so they scatter light in all directions, making clouds appear white.\r\n\r\nFair weather clouds are usually found at high altitudes, where the air is colder and the water droplets are tiny. Because the droplets are so small, they scatter all the colors of the spectrum, making the clouds appear white.\r\n\r\nStorm clouds, on the other hand, are usually found at lower altitudes, where the air is warmer. The water droplets in these clouds are larger, and they scatter mostly blue and violet light. Because these colors are on the shorter end of the light spectrum, they are not as visible to our eyes, making the clouds appear darker.\r\n\r\nWhen the water droplets in a cloud become too heavy to be held up by the air, they fall to the ground as precipitation, such as rain or snow. This happens because the water droplets or ice crystals in the cloud combine and grow, until they become too heavy to stay in the cloud and are pulled down by gravity.<>reddit_eli5
