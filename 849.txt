Vertigo reoccurring after a year. Taken meclizine. Advise?I had a bad case of Vertigo a year ago. I was prescribed 12.5mg Meclizine.  It worked along with physical therapy, but now it seems to be coming back.  It is not as bad, however, it seems to be constant causing me to worry about falling.It is the worst if I lay down on my back.  What advise do you have about this situation?<>Hi, thanks for writing to HCM.Apart from taking medicines, there are a few things that you should follow to prevent vertigo. They are as follows -* Change your position slowly, especially when going from a lying or sitting position to a standing position. When you get out of bed, sit on the side of the bed for a few seconds to gain your orientation and allow your circulatory system to adjust.* When walking, focus on distant objects. Do not look down at your feet. Avoid walking in dark areas or on unstable ground. * Use a cane, walking stick, or walker for support and to give additional pressure and touch (tactile) orientation.* Avoid activities that move the head up and down repetitively.* Try to avoid keeping the head tilted back for long periods of time, for example painting or dusting above your head.* Be cautious when using medications that may cause balance problems as a side effect.Hope this information is helpful. Good day<>I'm sorry to hear about your reoccurring vertigo. Vertigo is a sensation of dizziness or spinning that can be caused by a variety of underlying conditions. If you are experiencing vertigo and it is causing you significant discomfort or affecting your daily activities, it is important to speak with a healthcare professional for further evaluation and treatment.\n\nMeclizine is a medication that is often used to treat dizziness, vertigo, and motion sickness. It works by blocking the action of a chemical called acetylcholine in the brain, which can help reduce dizziness and nausea. If you have been taking meclizine and it is not providing adequate relief, or if you are experiencing side effects from the medication, it is important to discuss this with your healthcare provider. They may recommend an alternative treatment or adjust your current treatment plan.\n\nIn addition to taking medication, there are also other things that you can do to help manage your vertigo. For example, you may find it helpful to:\n\nAvoid sudden movements or changes in position, especially when you are lying down\nAvoid looking up or down for long periods of time\nAvoid bright lights or flickering screens\nDrink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated\nEat small, frequent meals rather than large ones\nPractice relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation, to help reduce anxiety and stress\nIt is also important to get enough rest and avoid activities that may trigger your vertigo, such as driving or operating heavy machinery. If your vertigo is severe or persistent, your healthcare provider may recommend additional treatment options, such as vestibular rehabilitation therapy or medication to control your symptoms.\n\nOverall, it is important to speak with a healthcare professional if you are experiencing persistent or worsening vertigo, as they can help determine the underlying cause and provide appropriate treatment.<>medicine
