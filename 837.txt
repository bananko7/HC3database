Why is French easier for English speakers to learn than German ? Is n’t English a Germanic language ? Should n’t its syntax and structure resemble German more than French ? Explain like I'm five. <>Who said that it 's easier to learn ? Everyone 's different . Some languages come easier to some people than others . Personally , German was easier for me to learn simply because I had more interest in German than French . Also , just to clarify : English is a mix of a few languages , one of them being French . The term \" Germanic \" in this context does n't necessarily mean \" like German \" . It 's a classification of a family of languages that share a common ancestor language , but which are today very different from each other .<>French and English are both Indo-European languages, but French is a Romance language and English is a Germanic language. That means that French is more closely related to languages like Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese, while English is more closely related to languages like German, Dutch, and Scandinavian languages.\\n\\nOne reason French might be easier for English speakers to learn is that both French and English have a lot of vocabulary in common. This is because many English words come from French, and the two languages have a shared history.\\n\\nAnother reason is that French has a more predictable sentence structure than English. In French, the verb is usually placed at the end of the sentence, which makes it easier to understand the overall structure of the sentence. In English, the verb can be placed in different parts of the sentence, which can make it harder to understand the meaning.\\n\\nFinally, French pronunciation is generally easier for English speakers to learn because it has a more consistent spelling-to-sound relationship than English. This means that in French, the way a word is spelled is usually a good indication of how it is pronounced, which makes it easier to read and speak the language.<>reddit_eli5
