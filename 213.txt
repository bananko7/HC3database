Why do cats do the massaging thing with their paws ? Specifically I 'm talking about [ THIS ] ( URL_0 ) Explain like I'm five.<>Two reasons : 1 ) When they are nursing as kittens , the kneading on mom 's nipples helps the milk come out . 2 ) They have scent glands in the pads of their paws , so this relates to the nursing again . Each kitten pretty much has its own nipple that it will go back to every time , because that 's where its scent is . They do this as they get older for the same reason they rub their faces against your legs ; territory ! So they are basically saying \" This is mine . And this is mine . Oh your leg ? Yeah that 's mine too . Pillow ? Mine . \"<>Cats do the massaging thing with their paws because it is a way for them to groom themselves. Grooming is an important behavior for cats because it helps them keep clean and healthy. When a cat licks its fur, it is removing dirt and debris from its coat. The massaging motion of a cat's paws helps to loosen and remove any tangles or knots in its fur.\n\nCats also use grooming as a way to mark their territory and communicate with other cats. When a cat grooms itself, it leaves a scent on its fur that other cats can detect. This scent marking helps cats to establish their presence in an area and can also help them to recognize other cats.\n\nSo, when a cat massages itself with its paws, it is performing an important self-care behavior that helps it to stay clean, healthy, and in touch with other cats.<>reddit_eli5
