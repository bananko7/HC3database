What is that sharp cramp that people get on the bottom right side of their rib cage when they start working out or doing Cardio ? Title . Please explain like I'm five.<>diaphragm cramp , commonly known as a stitch ? URL_0<>That sharp cramp you're describing is likely a side stitch, and it is a common problem that can occur when people are physically active, especially when they are doing activities like running or cycling. A side stitch is a pain that is felt in the side of the abdomen, usually just below the ribcage. It is often caused by a muscle spasm in the muscles that help to support the diaphragm, which is the muscle that helps you to breathe. \nSide stitches can be very painful, but they are usually not serious and will go away on their own after a few minutes. To help alleviate the pain of a side stitch, you can try slowing down your activity, taking deep breaths, and massaging the area where the pain is located. It may also help to bend forward slightly or to press on the area with your hand. \nIt's important to drink plenty of water and stay hydrated when you are physically active, as this can help to prevent side stitches. It's also a good idea to warm up before exercising and to stretch your muscles to help prevent cramps and other muscle pains.<>reddit_eli5
