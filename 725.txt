How did people browse the web before search engines ? Before AskJeeves , Yahoo , Google , etc . how could you find different Internet websites and just peruse around ? Even now , how can someone find things without using a search engine ? Explain like I'm five.<>Before search engines became common there were \" web directories \" when you wanted to find specific stuff . So if you wanted to look for something about , say , C++ you went to one of those and looked at \" Programming Languages \" which had a subheading of \" C++ \" that had a collection of interesting sites . People submitted sites they found to various directories to help others find them . Source : I was around .<>Before search engines like Google and Yahoo, people used directories to find websites. A directory is like a phone book for websites. You could look up a topic and find a list of websites related to that topic.\n\nAnother way to find websites was to ask friends or colleagues for recommendations, or to follow links from one website to another. For example, you might find a link to a website on a blog or in a forum, and then follow that link to visit the website.\n\nToday, people can still use directories and follow links to find websites, but search engines like Google make it much easier to find what you're looking for. When you use a search engine, you can type in a word or phrase and the search engine will show you a list of websites that are related to what you're looking for.\n\nSo, to find things on the internet without using a search engine, you can try using a directory or following links from one website to another. You can also ask friends or colleagues for recommendations, or try looking for information on social media or forums.<>reddit_eli5
