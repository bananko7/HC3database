As a first line management, you can take analgesics like Paracetamol or Aceclofenac for pain relief. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Shinas Hussain,General & Family Physician<>It's possible that you may have strained or pulled a muscle in your rib cage, or you may have bruised a rib. It's also possible that you may have injured a intercostal muscle, which is a muscle that runs between the ribs.\n\nTo help alleviate the pain, you can try the following:\n\nRest: Avoid strenuous activities and give your body time to heal.\n\nApply ice: Apply an ice pack to the affected area for 15-20 minutes every few hours to help reduce swelling and pain.\n\nTake over-the-counter pain medication: Ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help reduce inflammation and pain.\n\nUse heat: After a day or two, you can try applying heat to the affected area to help relax the muscles and reduce pain.\n\nPractice good posture: Make sure to sit and stand up straight to take pressure off of the affected area.\n\nIf the pain persists or gets worse, it's important to see a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment. They may recommend additional treatments such as physical therapy or medications to help manage the pain.<>medicine
