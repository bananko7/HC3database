Why do lightbulbs go out , but not the lights that illuminate screens on TVs and phones ? Is it even possible for them to go out ? Explain like I'm five. <>it is , DLP tvs for example used a honest bulb ( though very bright and powerful ) , and it had a life of a few years . LCD screens use edge lighting , most are LEDs these days ( all cell phones ) , but they used to use compact florescent lights ( rarely still do ) . both have absurdly long lifespans , longer than the devices they are in . but its possible for the backlight to fail . the newest phones ( and some TVs ) are OLED , which means the screen itself are itsy bitsy LEDs that generate the light themselves . again , super long life .<>Light bulbs go out because they have a limited lifespan. Inside a light bulb, there is a small filament made of a thin wire. When you turn on the light, electricity flows through the filament and heats it up until it glows, producing light. However, this process of heating up the filament also causes it to wear out over time. Eventually, the filament becomes so thin that it can't withstand the heat and pressure anymore, and it breaks. When the filament breaks, the light bulb goes out.\\n\\nThe lights that illuminate screens on TVs and phones are different from light bulbs. They use something called a backlight to produce light, which is typically made up of small, energy-efficient light-emitting diodes (LEDs). These LEDs have a much longer lifespan than filament bulbs, and they don't produce as much heat. Because of this, they don't wear out as quickly and are less likely to go out.\\n\\nIt is possible for the lights that illuminate screens on TVs and phones to go out, but it is less common. If an LED light stops working, it might be because it has been damaged in some way or because it has reached the end of its lifespan. In general, though, LED lights are very reliable and can last for many years before they need to be replaced.<>reddit_eli5
