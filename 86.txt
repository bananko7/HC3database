How cassette games work How do old video game consoles use cassettes as games when cassettes are just audio ? Please explain like I'm five.<>The data was represented as audio on the tape . When loading a program from tape the computer would listen to the noises - usually lots of screeching - and understand them as the bytes of the program which it could then run from its memory . We used to use a similar technique to access the intent using a normal phone line - your computer would call another computer and they would screech at each other to send data back and forth . So yes tapes are just audio but you can represent computer code as audio !<>Cassette tapes were a popular way to store data in the past, before things like USB drives and online storage were common. Just like how a cassette tape can store music by recording the sound waves on the tape, a cassette tape can also store computer data by recording a series of ones and zeros (binary code) on the tape.Old video game consoles had a special cassette player built into them that could read the data on the cassette tapes and use it to run a video game. The console would play back the data on the tape and use it to control what was happening on the screen. It was a bit like how a record player plays music from a record, but instead of music, the cassette player was playing a video game.<>reddit_eli5
