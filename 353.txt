Can you deduct hobby expenses up to hobby income in Canada?<>Yes, your business needs to be in the business of making money in order for you to deduct the expenses associated with it. I suppose in theory this could mean that if you take in $10,000 and spend $30,000 every year, you not only don't get a net deduction of $20,000 (your loss) but you have to pay tax on $10,000 (your revenue). However this is super fixable. Just only deduct $9500 of your expenses. Tada! Small profit.For all the gory details, including how they consider whether you have an expectation of profits, see http:\/\/www.cra-arc.gc.ca\/E\/pub\/gl\/p-176r\/p-176r-e.html This \"expectation of profit\" rule appears to apply to things like \"I sell home d√©cor items (or home decorating advice) and therefore need to take several multi week trips to exotic vacation destinations every year and deduct them as business expenses.\" If you're doing woodworking or knitting in your home and selling on Etsy you don't particularly have any expenses. It's hard to imagine a scenario where you consistently sell for less than the cost of materials and then end up dinged on paying tax on revenue.<>In Canada, you generally cannot deduct hobby expenses from your taxable income. Expenses that are incurred in carrying on a hobby are generally not tax-deductible because the activity is not considered to be a business.However, if you earn income from a hobby and the activity is carried on in a business-like manner, you may be able to claim certain expenses as business expenses. To be considered a business, the activity must be carried on with the intention of making a profit.If you have any doubts about whether your hobby is a business or whether you can claim certain expenses, you should consult with a tax professional or the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). The CRA has published a guide called \"Are You Carrying on a Business?\" that provides more information on this topic.<>finance
