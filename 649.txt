It was an agreement between the king of England, King John, and a group of powerful noblemen. The Magna Carta was important because it established some basic rights and freedoms for the people of England. It said that the king could not just do whatever he wanted, and that he had to follow certain rules. Some of the things that the Magna Carta established were the right to a fair trial, the right to be protected from unjust punishment, and the right to own property. It also said that the king had to listen to the advice of a group of important people called \"barons\" when making decisions about how to run the country. The Magna Carta was signed by King John and a group of nobles. It has had a very big impact on history because it helped to establish the idea that even kings and queens have to follow the law, and that the people have certain rights that the government must respect. This idea has influenced the way that many countries around the world are governed today.<>reddit_eli5
