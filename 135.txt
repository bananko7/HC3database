What does auto - tune actually do ? What is it physically doing to someones voice ? How much power does it take ? Is T - Paine 's app an accurate representation of auto - tune ? Explain like I'm five.<>Auto - tune uses digital processing to shift the pitch of a voice to the closest note . That way even if someone sings a bit off - key the audience wo n't notice[1 ] . It 's something that runs in a digital signal processor , so it does n't really use any more power than a tiny computer does . I have no idea what T - Paine 's app is . [ 1 ] Well , they might notice the exact characteristics of an auto - tuner , but they wo n't notice someone being off - key .<>Auto-Tune is a software effect that is used to adjust the pitch of a vocal recording to match a target pitch, often to make the singing more in tune. It works by analyzing the pitch of the vocal recording and then slightly adjusting the pitch of the recording to match the target pitch.\r\n\r\nAuto-Tune does this by changing the pitch of the individual notes in the vocal recording. It does not change the overall pitch of the entire recording, but rather makes small adjustments to the pitch of specific notes.\r\n\r\nAuto-Tune does not require a lot of power to run, as it is just a software effect that can be used on a computer or other device.\r\n\r\nT-Pain's app is a simplified version of Auto-Tune that is designed to be used on a smartphone. It allows users to apply the Auto-Tune effect to their own singing or speaking voice in real-time, creating a similar effect to the one used by T-Pain and other popular musicians.<>reddit_eli5
