Why do FM radio stations end in .1 .3 .5 .7 or .9 but AM stations can end evenly ? in other words , why do all FM stations end in an odd decimal like 96.3 but all AM stations can end in an even whole number like 1120 Explain like I'm five.
An FM station requires a large range on either side of its frequency , because , it 's frequency modulation . A station of \" 96.3 \" really uses from 96.2 MHz to 96.4 Mhz . For ease of use , the center frequency is the one called the true \" frequency \" of the station . AM stations can be closer because they do n't change their frequency to send sound information - they use amplitude instead . * Source : URL_0
FM radio stations use a different part of the radio spectrum than AM radio stations. FM radio stations use frequencies that are between 88 megahertz and 108 megahertz. This part of the radio spectrum is divided into 200 kilohertz increments, and each increment is assigned a number. The numbers go from 88.1 to 107.9. AM radio stations use frequencies that are between 540 kilohertz and 1600 kilohertz. This part of the radio spectrum is divided into 10 kilohertz increments, and each increment is assigned a number. The numbers go from 540 to 1610. FM radio stations use decimal numbers because their frequencies are measured in megahertz, which are very small units. AM radio stations use whole numbers because their frequencies are measured in kilohertz, which are larger units. The reason why FM radio stations always end in .1, .3, .5, .7, or .9 is because those are the numbers that are assigned to each 200 kilohertz increment in the FM radio spectrum. The reason why AM radio stations can end in even whole numbers is because those are the numbers that are assigned to each 10 kilohertz increment in the AM radio spectrum. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
