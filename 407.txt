Why would this FHA refinance cause my mortgage insurance payment to increase so much?<>If you're refinancing a conforming (Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac) mortgage, don't go with an FHA. Try a HARP refinance, which won't increase your mortgage insurance even if your home has lost value. HARP also limits the risk-based pricing adjustments that can be charged, so your rate should be very competitive. With an FHA mortgage, even once you get the loan-to-value ratio down to 80 percent, you still have mortgage insurance for several years, plus the upfront costs. In your case, I think it's a bad deal.<>There are a few reasons why your mortgage insurance payment may increase when refinancing an FHA loan:If you are refinancing from a conventional loan to an FHA loan, your mortgage insurance payment may increase because FHA mortgage insurance premiums are typically higher than those for conventional loans.If you are refinancing from an older FHA loan to a newer one, your mortgage insurance payment may increase because FHA mortgage insurance premiums have increased over time.If you are refinancing from an FHA loan with a lower mortgage insurance premium to one with a higher premium, your mortgage insurance payment may increase.If you are refinancing an FHA loan with a fixed rate to an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM), your mortgage insurance payment may increase because ARM loans generally have higher mortgage insurance premiums.It's important to carefully consider the terms of your refinance and the potential impact on your mortgage insurance payment before proceeding. It may be helpful to speak with a mortgage lender or financial advisor to understand the specific reasons for the increase in your mortgage insurance payment and to determine if refinancing is the right decision for you.","There are a few potential reasons why your mortgage insurance payment might increase significantly when refinancing an FHA loan:You are refinancing into a new loan with a higher interest rate: If the interest rate on your new loan is higher than the rate on your current loan, your mortgage insurance payment may go up, because the mortgage insurance is typically calculated as a percentage of the loan amount.You are increasing the loan term: If you are refinancing into a new loan with a longer term, your mortgage insurance payment may go up, because the mortgage insurance is typically calculated based on the loan term.You are taking cash out: If you are refinancing to take cash out of your home equity, your mortgage insurance payment may go up, because the mortgage insurance is typically calculated based on the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, which will increase if you are borrowing more money.Your credit score has decreased: If your credit score has decreased since you took out your current loan, your mortgage insurance payment may go up, because mortgage insurance premiums are generally higher for borrowers with lower credit scores.It's important to carefully consider all of these factors when deciding whether to refinance your FHA loan, and to compare the costs and benefits of different refinancing options to determine which one is right for you.<>finance
