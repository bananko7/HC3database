Why do tv show hosts always sit on the right , while the guest sits on the left ? Any tv show with a host that I have seen sits on the right . I ca n't think of one where the host sits on the left . Please explain like I'm five.<>Because it makes them seem powerful . In Western culture , we read from left to right , and we watch theater and television that way , too . Our eyes end up on the right side of the screen â€” where the host sits ( also known as stage left ) . In the theory of stagecraft , it 's understood that a rightward placement telegraphs royalty . So no matter how famous the guest may be , sitting to the left makes him or her seem subservient .<>There is no particular reason why television show hosts always sit on the right while guests sit on the left. This is just a convention that has been followed by many television shows. It is possible that the layout of the set or the position of the cameras might have influenced this decision. It is also possible that the placement of the host and guest is chosen based on other factors, such as the dynamics of the conversation or the overall aesthetic of the show. Ultimately, the seating arrangement of the host and guest is a matter of personal preference and can vary from show to show.<>reddit_eli5
