What is the purpose of those black lines on car windows ? I 'm referring to those thin black lines on car windows , usually the Windows by the back seats of larger cars . Please explain like I'm five.<>In general , they are defroster wires , when you turn on the rear defroster , the wires get hot , and melt any frost \/ ice that might be on the rear window . Or help evaporate any condensation that may have accumulated on the rear window . In some cases , one or two of those wires might be radio antennas , for the car stereo .<>Those thin black lines on the car windows are called window seals. They are there to help keep the window in place and to keep water and air from getting inside the car.Think about it like this: when you close a window, you want it to stay closed and not open up again on its own. The window seal helps to hold the window in place so that it stays closed.Additionally, the window seal helps to keep water out of the car. When it rains, the water can't just drip straight into the car because the window seal blocks it. This helps to keep you and the inside of the car dry.The window seal also helps to keep air from getting inside the car. This is important because you don't want a lot of wind or cold air coming into the car when you are driving. The window seal helps to keep the inside of the car comfortable and helps to keep the temperature inside the car stable.I hope that helps! Do you have any other questions about car windows or seals?<>reddit_eli5
