How did they get the provided image from the voyager ? [ This is the image I 'm talking about . ] ( URL_0 ) If the voyager was 4 billion miles away , how did we get a data signal back from it ? Explain like I'm five.<>Hi . You 'd wan to check out the Deep Space Network . It 's cool . Sets of telescopes and observing stations are setup in three-4 locations to communicate with our assets .<>The image you provided is from the Voyager 1 spacecraft, which was launched in 1977 and is currently over 14 billion miles away from Earth. Voyager 1 is equipped with a camera and other scientific instruments that it uses to study the objects in our solar system and the space around us.\r\n\r\nWhen Voyager 1 takes a picture or gathers scientific data, it sends that information back to Earth using a radio transmitter. Radio waves are a type of energy that can travel through space, and Voyager 1's radio transmitter sends the information it collects back to Earth as radio waves.\r\n\r\nOn Earth, we have a special antenna that is designed to receive radio waves from Voyager 1. When the antenna picks up the radio waves, it converts them back into the information that was sent, like a picture or scientific data. This is how we are able to see the images and learn about the things Voyager 1 is studying, even though it is so far away.<>reddit_eli5
