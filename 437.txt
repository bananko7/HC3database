Who buys gasoline \/ oil on the black market ? Is there a real market outside the middle east ? Do companies just buy black market oil and then refine it for a higher profit margin ? Please explain like I'm five.<>No one buys straight black market oil ( at least not anyone big , too risky ) . A producer or refiner might simply mix some in to the \" legit \" oil and then sell that as normal .<>The black market for gasoline and oil refers to the illegal trade of these products, typically in countries where there are strict government controls on the sale and distribution of such products. This can occur for a variety of reasons, such as to evade taxes, to bypass trade sanctions, or to sell products that have been stolen or smuggled. \nIn some cases, companies may be involved in the black market trade of gasoline and oil, either by buying these products illegally and then refining them for a higher profit margin, or by selling them directly to consumers through illegal channels. However, it is important to note that buying and selling gasoline and oil on the black market is illegal and can carry serious consequences. \nIt is difficult to quantify the size of the black market for gasoline and oil, as it operates outside of legal channels and is not subject to official reporting or regulation. However, it is likely that the black market for these products exists in many countries around the world, not just in the Middle East.<>reddit_eli5
