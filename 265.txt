Why ca n't we just cut a cancerous tumor out ? I know for some places in the body that develop tumors , we ca n't just cut them out ? Why is that ? If bleeding is an issue could n't we just cauterize it ? Please explain like I'm five.<>That is indeed what we try to do for many tumors . The problem is that cells can escape from that localized area and travel to other parts of the body . Once that happens , it 's extremely difficult to stop because you ca n't simply \" take it out \" any more , and those cells could end up all over the place . You then need to use other techniques like chemotherapy .<>Sure! Removing a cancerous tumor can often help improve a person's health and quality of life. However, it's not always as simple as just cutting the tumor out. Here are a few reasons why: 1. Location: Sometimes, tumors are located in areas of the body that are hard to reach or operate on, such as near important blood vessels or organs. This can make it difficult or even dangerous to remove the tumor. 2. Size: If a tumor is very large, it might be hard to remove all of it without damaging surrounding healthy tissue. 3. Spread: Cancer cells can spread, or metastasize, from the original tumor to other parts of the body. This means that even if the doctor removes the main tumor, there might still be cancer cells in other areas that need to be treated. 4. Cauterization: Cauterization is a way to stop bleeding by burning the blood vessels shut. While it can be helpful in some cases, it's not always the best option for removing a tumor because it can also damage healthy tissue. In summary, removing a cancerous tumor is not always easy because of the location, size, and spread of the tumor, and cauterization is not always the best option.<>reddit_eli5
