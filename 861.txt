Why do cats lick the air or whatever is nearest to them when you scratch the base of their tail ? I always figured it was the same as how a dog kicks their legs when you rub their belly . Explain like I'm five.<>My cat has never done this , now i m worried i m not satisfying my buttons like i should be:- ( That sounds weird but ill stick with it anyway<>When you scratch a cat's tail base, it can feel really good to them, kind of like how a massage feels good to humans. Sometimes cats will lick the air or nearby objects as a way of showing that they are enjoying the sensation. It's also possible that cats lick things as a way of grooming themselves, to help keep their fur clean and healthy. So when you scratch a cat's tail base, they might start licking as a way of saying \"thank you\" or \"this feels good!\"<>reddit_eli5
