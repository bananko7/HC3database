Why do some electronics have power cables that are n't connected to the device ? For example , a lot of alarm clocks have cables that can be unplugged from the device . What benefit does this have ? Explain like I'm five.<>For one , the cables can be replaced if they become frayed . Secondly , a detachable cable that will just come off if under stress is n't as likely to fail as a cable that will be yanking at soldered wire joints if pulled on .<>Electronics often have power cables that can be unplugged from the device because it makes it easier for the user to move the device around or to store it when it is not in use. The power cable is typically connected to a wall outlet or a power strip, which provides electricity to the device. When the device is not in use, the user can simply unplug the power cable from the device, which will disconnect the device from the electricity source and prevent it from using any power. This is especially useful for devices that are not used all the time, such as an alarm clock, because it can help save energy and reduce the user's electricity bills.<>reddit_eli5
