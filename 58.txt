Where to Park Proceeds from House Sale for 2-5 Years?
Individual municipal bonds (not a fund) that will come to term in 2017 from your state.  This satisfies 1, 2, 4 and 5.   It doesn't satisfy #2.  These are not insured, and there can be details in each state about whether the municipal bonds are backed up by state general revenues in the event of a municipal bankruptcy; there are two general kinds, \"general obligation\" backed by the political will to raise taxes if needed; and \"revenue bonds\" backed by cash flow such as toll revenue, water utility bills and so forth.  Municipal bankruptcies are rare but not impossible.   http:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/finance\/investing\/avoid-municipal-bonds-that-default-2.aspx
There are several options you can consider for parking the proceeds from the sale of your house for a period of 2-5 years. Some options to consider include:High-yield savings account: If you need quick and easy access to your funds, a high-yield savings account may be a good option. These accounts typically offer higher interest rates than traditional savings accounts and are FDIC-insured, so your money is safe.Money market account: Similar to a high-yield savings account, a money market account offers a higher interest rate and FDIC insurance. However, these accounts often require a higher minimum balance and may have stricter withdrawal limits.Certificate of deposit (CD): A CD is a type of time deposit offered by banks and credit unions. You agree to leave your money in the CD for a set period of time, usually several months to several years, and in return, you receive a higher interest rate. CDs are FDIC-insured, but you may face a penalty if you withdraw your money before the term is up.Short-term bond fund: If you are willing to take on a little bit of risk in exchange for potentially higher returns, you may want to consider investing in a short-term bond fund. These funds invest in bonds with maturities of less than five years, so they are less sensitive to changes in interest rates. However, bond prices can fluctuate, and there is the potential for loss of principal.It's important to consider your own financial goals and risk tolerance when deciding where to park your proceeds from the sale of your house. It may also be helpful to speak with a financial advisor or professional to get personalized advice on the best options for your situation.
