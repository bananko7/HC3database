The Holy Roman Empire How did it start ? Why was it important at the time ? How did it phase out ? Explain like I'm five.<>One good quote to remember about the HRE : \" This agglomeration ( jumbled collection of things ) which was called and which still calls itself * * the Holy Roman Empire was neither holy , nor Roman , nor an empire * * . \" - Voltaire<>The Holy Roman Empire was a political and religious entity that existed in Europe for over a thousand years. It was founded in the year 800 when the Pope crowned the Frankish king Charlemagne as the \"Emperor of the Romans.\" This event marked the beginning of the Holy Roman Empire, which was seen as the successor to the Roman Empire that had ruled much of Europe for hundreds of years. The Holy Roman Empire was important at the time because it was a powerful and influential state that controlled a large part of Europe. The emperors of the Holy Roman Empire were seen as the spiritual and political leaders of the Christian world, and they had a lot of authority and influence over the other European monarchs. The Holy Roman Empire eventually phased out in the early 19th century. In 1806, the Holy Roman Emperor Francis II dissolved the empire and proclaimed himself the Emperor of Austria. This marked the end of the Holy Roman Empire, which had been in decline for many years due to a variety of factors, including political and economic problems.<>reddit_eli5
