Why does PAL and NTSC exist ? Why not just have one standard ? Oh , and why do those standards only apply to TVs and not computer monitors or phone screens ? Sorry if that was a lot of questions in one Please explain like I'm five.<>PAL and NTSC were methods of encoding TV in an analog signal . Europe uses 50Hz electricity , USA uses 60Hz electricity . Since the analog signal is related to the frequency of the electricity powering the device , Europe and USA had different TV standards to . With early computer monitors ( driven by CGA or EGA ) you did worry about PAL \/ NTSC . Once VGA came along , that introduced a new analog standard that had a higher resolution than PAL \/ NTSC . And after VGA came digital standards .<>PAL and NTSC are two different television broadcast standards that were developed in the 20th century. These standards specify the number of lines that make up the picture on a television screen, as well as the refresh rate (how often the picture is updated) and the colors that can be displayed. \nPAL stands for Phase Alternating Line and is used in most of Europe, Africa, and parts of Asia. NTSC stands for National Television System Committee and is used in North and Central America, and parts of Asia. \nOne reason why there are multiple standards is because different countries and regions developed their own television systems at different times. As a result, each system is optimized for the specific needs of that region, such as the type of signals that can be transmitted over the airwaves or through cables, or the available technologies for displaying images on a screen. \nComputer monitors and phone screens do not use these standards because they are not designed to receive and display television signals. Instead, they use their own display technologies and standards that are optimized for displaying images and video from a computer or phone.<>reddit_eli5
