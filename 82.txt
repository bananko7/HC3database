Why does n't someone add a bad odor to Carbon Monoxide ? If a sulphur smell can be added to gas to help alert us , why ca n't something like that be done for carbon monoxide ? Please explain like I'm five.<>CO is n't manufactured or stored , like natural gas or propane . Carbon monoxide is usually generated because of an improperly operated or maintained machine ; you ca n't really \" add \" a scent to a product of poorly executed combustion , without using some kind of CO detector that releases a foul smell when it detects CO . At that point , it 's more effective to just sound an alarm .<>Carbon monoxide is a colorless and odorless gas, which makes it difficult for people to detect. This is actually one of the reasons why carbon monoxide can be so dangerous - it is difficult to detect without the use of special equipment. However, some people have suggested adding a bad smell to carbon monoxide to make it easier to detect. While this may seem like a good idea, there are a few reasons why it might not work well in practice. First, it can be difficult to find a smell that is strong enough to be noticed, but not so strong that it becomes overwhelming or irritating. Second, some people may not be able to smell certain odors due to age, illness, or other factors, so a bad smell may not be a reliable way to detect carbon monoxide for everyone. Finally, even if a bad smell was added to carbon monoxide, people may not always be able to recognize it as a warning sign, especially if they have never smelled it before. There are other ways to detect carbon monoxide, such as using special detectors that are placed in homes and other buildings. These detectors can alert people to the presence of carbon monoxide, even if they cannot smell it.<>reddit_eli5
