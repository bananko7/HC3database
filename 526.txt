Why do animals need to sleep ? We eat to get energy , and muscles regenerate over time , why is the brain so poorly evolved to require such frequent reboots ? Explain like I'm five.<>The truth is that sleep is a huge mystery even to the best scientists in the world .<>Great question! Sleep is actually a very important part of an animal's life, and it's not just the brain that needs it. When we sleep, our bodies and brains are able to rest and repair themselves. During sleep, the body is able to repair and regenerate tissues, build bone and muscle, and strengthen the immune system. The brain is also able to process and consolidate memories from the day. Sleep is also important for our overall health and well-being. Not getting enough sleep can lead to a variety of problems, including difficulty concentrating, a decrease in physical and mental performance, and an increased risk of certain diseases. So, while it may seem strange that animals need to sleep, it's actually a very important part of their lives. It helps their bodies and brains to stay healthy and function properly.<>reddit_eli5
