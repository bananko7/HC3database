How can something other than water have 0 calories ? Searched around and all I could find were examples of 0 calorie things such as diet soda or artificial sweetener . I ca n't understand how something that has taste could have 0 calories . Explain like I'm five.<>Calorie is a term of energy measurment . Some things simply provide no energy for your body , such as certain minerals , dietary fiber , and other compounds that our body can not convert to energy<>Sure! Some things, like diet soda and artificial sweeteners, are made to taste sweet, but they don't have any calories. That means they don't have any energy in them, which our bodies need to use to do things like move, think, and grow. Water doesn't have any calories either, but it doesn't have a taste. It's just a plain liquid that our bodies need to stay healthy and hydrated.<>reddit_eli5
