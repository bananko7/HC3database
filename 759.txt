Why should n't you clean your earwax ? Is cleaning your earwax really that bad for your ear health ? Also does it matter if I have really dry earwax and I get rid of them with an earpick ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Cleaning earwax is fine , cleaning too much is when their is an issue . As earwax protects your ears from excess sound , so too little earwax can result in damaged eardrums . I normally just wrap a tissue round my little finger and clean my ear , this means that only some wax is cleaned as the finger is too big to go fully into the ear .<>It's not generally recommended to clean your earwax because the earwax in your ears serves an important purpose. Earwax helps to keep your ears healthy and clean by trapping dirt, dust, and other particles that could potentially harm your ears. It also helps to keep the skin inside your ears moisturized and healthy. Using ear picks or other methods to clean your earwax can actually be harmful to your ear health. This is because it can cause damage to the skin inside your ear and can also push earwax deeper into your ear, which can lead to earwax blockages. If you have dry earwax, it's important to try to keep your ears moisturized. You can use a few drops of baby oil or mineral oil in your ears to help keep the skin inside your ears moist and healthy. In general, it's best to leave your earwax alone and let it do its job of keeping your ears healthy and clean. If you're concerned about excess earwax or if you think you may have an earwax blockage, it's a good idea to talk to your doctor or a healthcare professional for advice and treatment.<>reddit_eli5
