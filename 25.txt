how do we know the laws of physics are constant through out the observable universe ? As in , how do we know that the laws of physics in our galaxy are the same as our neighbouring galaxies or even those on the otherside of the universe ? Thanks Explain like I'm five. 
We essentially do n't - we just guess But it 's a VERY educated guess . Physicists over the years have conducted thousands and thousands of experiments that have shown that the laws of physics remain constant . In the absence of any evidence or any ( provable ) theory to say otherwise physics is able to proceed under the assumption that the laws of physics are constant . It 's a very solid assumption , but it 's still an assumption . If anybody was ever able to prove conclusively otherwise they would permanently alter the study of physics
The laws of physics are based on the fundamental principles that govern how the universe works. These principles are thought to be the same everywhere in the universe, because they are based on the properties of matter and energy, which are thought to be the same everywhere.\\n\\nOne way we can test whether the laws of physics are the same throughout the universe is by observing how objects behave under the influence of various forces, such as gravity. For example, if we observe a planet orbiting a star, we can use the laws of physics to predict how fast the planet will move and how it will change its direction over time. If we observe similar behavior in other parts of the universe, it suggests that the laws of physics are the same everywhere.\\n\\nWe can also test the constancy of the laws of physics by studying how light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation travel through the universe. For example, if we observe a distant galaxy and measure the wavelengths of the light coming from it, we can compare those measurements to the wavelengths of light we observe here on Earth. If the wavelengths are the same, it suggests that the laws of physics that govern the behavior of light are the same everywhere in the universe.\\n\\nOverall, the evidence we have gathered so far suggests that the laws of physics are the same throughout the observable universe, but it is possible that there may be some differences in very distant or hard-to-observe parts of the universe.
