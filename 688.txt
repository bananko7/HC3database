Why do countries have similar flags ? Like when I look at my map , the Czech Republic , Serbia , Slovenia , Slovakia and Russia have very similar flags and there are alot more . Can someone explain this or is it just a lack of creativity ? Explain like I'm five.<>Red , blue and white are long considered to be Slavic colors ( at least by Slavs themselves ) so they based their flags on them ... See URL_1 You can see similar trend in Nordic countries , but it is n't based on common colors but on common theme - Scandinavian cross - see URL_0<>There are many reasons why countries might have similar flags. One reason is that many countries have a shared history or cultural heritage. For example, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Slovenia were all part of the former Czechoslovakia, and so they may have chosen to keep similar elements in their flags as a way to honor that shared history. Similarly, Serbia and Russia are both Eastern European countries with a long shared history, so it's not surprising that their flags might have some similarities. Another reason why flags might be similar is that they use common symbols or colors that have a shared meaning. For example, many countries use the color red to represent courage and bravery, or the color blue to represent peace and tranquility. Some countries also use common symbols like stars or stripes to represent different things, like the states or regions within the country. Finally, it's also possible that some countries simply haven't had the opportunity to create unique flags because they have only recently gained independence or because they have been influenced by other countries in the past. Overall, while there are certainly some countries with similar flags, there are also many countries with very unique and distinct flags, each with its own special meaning and symbolism.<>reddit_eli5
