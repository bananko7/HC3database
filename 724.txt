Why do countries have different voltage for appliances ? Like in the U.S it 's 220\/240v AC , while in Brazil and many other places it 's 110\/140v AC . Explain like I'm five.<>First , I believe you mistyped and meant 120\/240v in the US . There is a trade - off between voltage and power lost due to resistance . Very few things in your house use even 120v , so why so much voltage ? First you need to know some simple concepts about electricity . For a certain amount of power running through a wire , you can increase the current by decreasing the voltage and vice vera , according to this formula : Power= Voltage * Current So if I have a cable with 120v at 2 amps of current , and another line with 240v at 1 amp , those two cables are carrying the same amount of electricity . It 's like two streams , one is twice as wide as the other , but the thinner one is twice as fast . So why choose one over the other ? This brings us to our last electrical concept : The power lost to heat from the resistance of the wire we use is based on the CURRENT only . The more current , the more energy lost to heat caused by the resistance of the conductor . Now the reason we use high - power lines is clear , transporting electricity at high voltages and stepping the voltage down close to where it is used is more efficient . In the end the precise voltages you use are arbitrary , as Mr. JelloTree said , but once you commit , you can bet a power network is n't going to want to change , as there are massive economies of scale in keeping components standard .<>The voltage of an electric power system refers to the amount of electric pressure or force that is used to push electricity through the wires to your home or business. Different countries use different voltage levels because they have different electricity needs.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, the standard voltage is 220\/240 volts, which is necessary to power larger appliances like refrigerators and clothes dryers. In Brazil and many other countries, the standard voltage is lower, at 110\/140 volts, which is sufficient for powering smaller appliances like phones and laptops.\r\n\r\nIt's important to use the correct voltage for your appliances, because if you use a voltage that is too high or too low, it can damage the appliance or cause it to not work properly. That's why many appliances come with built-in voltage converters, so you can use them in different countries with different voltage levels.<>reddit_eli5
