Why do car speedometers go upto speeds over 220kph when the maximum speed limit the cars encounter is often only 110kph ? I 'm in Australia , so those speeds are just what I 'm used to Please explain like I'm five.<>This gets asked almost every day . It basically boils down to this : a car with a maximum speed approximately at the speed limit would have so little power ( and such slow acceleration ) that consumers would reject it . So what you see are cars with significantly more power than they need to maintain highway speeds , and the need to measure the speeds at which they are actually capable of travelling .<>Car speedometers are designed to measure a wide range of speeds because different countries have different speed limits and because some roads have no speed limit at all. In Australia, for example, there are some highways where cars are allowed to go as fast as they want. So, even if the speed limit on most roads is 110 kph, the car's speedometer needs to be able to measure higher speeds in case the car is ever driven on a highway where there is no speed limit. Does that make sense?<>reddit_eli5
