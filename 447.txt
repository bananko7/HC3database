Please explain what is \"Cryptographic hash function\"<>A cryptographic hash function (CHF) is a hash algorithm (a map of an arbitrary binary string to a binary string with fixed size of \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n bits) that has special properties desirable for cryptography:\nCryptographic hash functions have many information-security applications, notably in digital signatures, message authentication codes (MACs), and other forms of authentication. They can also be used as ordinary hash functions, to index data in hash tables, for fingerprinting, to detect duplicate data or uniquely identify files, and as checksums to detect accidental data corruption. Indeed, in information-security contexts, cryptographic hash values are sometimes called (digital) fingerprints, checksums, or just hash values, even though all these terms stand for more general functions with rather different properties and purposes.<>A cryptographic hash function is a mathematical function that takes an input (or 'message') and returns a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a hexadecimal number. The main property of a cryptographic hash function is that it is computationally infeasible to find two different input messages that produce the same hash output. This makes it a useful tool for verifying the integrity of a message or data file, as any changes to the input will result in a different hash output.\n\n\n\nCryptographic hash functions are also known as 'digest functions' or 'one-way functions', as it is easy to compute the hash of a message, but it is very difficult to recreate the original message from its hash. This makes them useful for storing passwords, as the original password cannot be easily determined from the stored hash.\n\n\n\nSome examples of cryptographic hash functions include SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm), MD5 (Message-Digest Algorithm 5), and RIPEMD-160 (RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest).<>wiki_csai
