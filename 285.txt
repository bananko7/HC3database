- Why New York City 's 5 boroughs count as one city . This is the same for Los Angeles , with Hollywood , Malibu , etc ... Why are these counted as whole cities when they 're actually smaller municipalities ? Explain like I'm five.<>It has to do with the way in which NYC of today came about . Prior to 1898 NYC was separate cities \/ towns . Prior to consolidation Brooklyn was its own city \/ county , Manhattan and parts of The Bronx were just \" New York City \" and a part of New York County , Queens was a variety of cities \/ towns in Queens County , and Staten Island was made up of a variety of towns in Richmond County . When the city was consolidated they decided to keep the counties as is ( for the most part ) and call the previously independent parts of the city boroughs . Almost no government exists on the borough level . There are borough presidents and they have minimal power and that 's about it , all normal city functions are carried out by city government . Because each borough is a New York State county each borough elects its own DA and judges , and has separate court systems , meaning if you are a resident of Queens you will get called for jury duty in Queens . URL_1 URL_0<>New York City is made up of five boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx, and Staten Island. These boroughs are all part of the same city because they are all governed by the same city government and have the same laws and regulations. They are also all located relatively close to each other and are connected by roads, bridges, and public transportation.\n\nIn the same way, the city of Los Angeles is made up of many smaller municipalities, such as Hollywood and Malibu, but they are all governed by the same city government and are considered to be part of the same city.\n\nSo, even though these cities are made up of smaller municipalities, they are still considered to be one city because they are all governed by the same city government and are connected to each other in some way.<>reddit_eli5
