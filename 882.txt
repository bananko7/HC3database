How is nuclear power a source of clean energy when one has to spend energy on digging out the ores and subsequently refining them . In addition , more energy is used to dispose the waste right ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Simply put , clean is a question of degrees . Coal and Oil have to be gotten out of the ground and refined as well . The components of a solar panel or wind farm likewise have to be gotten out of the ground and refined . The difference is that nuclear produces a lot more energy per unit of pollution created .<>Nuclear power is a clean energy source because it does not produce any greenhouse gases or other air pollutants when it generates electricity. It is also very efficient, meaning that it can produce a lot of electricity from a small amount of fuel.To make nuclear power, we have to dig up a special kind of rock called uranium. Uranium is used as fuel for nuclear power plants. Digging up and refining uranium does require some energy, but once we have the fuel, we can use it to produce a lot of electricity with very little pollution.One of the challenges with nuclear power is what to do with the waste that is produced. Nuclear waste is very dangerous because it is radioactive, meaning it can harm people if we are not careful with it. However, there are ways to safely store nuclear waste so that it does not harm people or the environment.So even though there are some energy and environmental costs associated with nuclear power, it is still considered a clean energy source because it produces very little pollution compared to other sources of electricity, like coal or natural gas.<>reddit_eli5
