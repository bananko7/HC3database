83(b) and long term capital gain<>You should apply for 83(b) within 30 days. 10 months is too late, sorry.<>An 83(b) election is a provision in the US tax code that allows taxpayers to choose to be taxed on the fair market value of property they receive in connection with the performance of services, rather than when they sell the property. This election is typically made in the case of restricted stock, which is stock that is subject to vesting and is not immediately transferable.Making an 83(b) election can be beneficial in certain circumstances, as it allows the taxpayer to pay tax on the value of the restricted stock at the time it is received, rather than waiting until it vests and potentially paying a higher tax rate on a larger amount of income. However, this election also carries some risk, as the taxpayer is required to pay tax on the value of the restricted stock at the time it is received, even if the value decreases in the future.Long-term capital gains are profits from the sale of assets held for more than one year. In the US, long-term capital gains are generally taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income, although the exact rate depends on the taxpayer's income level.It's worth noting that making an 83(b) election does not affect the tax treatment of any gain or loss on the sale of the stock. If the stock is sold at a later date and the sale results in a gain, that gain would be subject to either long-term or short-term capital gains tax, depending on how long the stock was held.<>finance
