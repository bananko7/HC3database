if looked at under an extremely powerful microscope , what would sub - atomic particles look like ? What would the space between them look like ? Edit : sorry if the flair is inappropriate Explain like I'm five. <>Part of the problem with you question is that \" looking \" is something that is not independent of size . Visible light has a wavelength from 390 to 700 nm ( 3.9 to 4 x 10^âˆ’7 m ) while atoms have a radius of 30 to 300 pm ( 3 to 30 x10 ^ -11 m ) . So seeing is not really applicable here visible light does not work at this scale .<>If we were to look at subatomic particles, like electrons or protons, under an extremely powerful microscope, we might see them as small, blurry balls of energy. The space between them might look like a vast, empty emptiness. But it's important to keep in mind that subatomic particles are very, very small and are constantly moving and changing, so it's hard to say exactly what they would look like.\\n\\nIn fact, it's not really possible to see subatomic particles using a microscope, because they are too small to be seen with light. Instead, scientists use other kinds of instruments, like particle accelerators, to study subatomic particles and learn more about them.<>reddit_eli5
