The seizure of illegal property . Let 's say the police raid a warehouse , and they arrests a bunch of guys . They also find a lot of cash , a lot of drugs , and a lot of guns . What happens to it all ? Explain like I'm five.<>All of it gets taken as evidence , gets used in the following trial , and then is either ordered destroyed or kept in an evidence store room .<>If the police find illegal items, such as drugs or illegal guns, during a raid, they will seize the items as evidence. This means they will take them and keep them in a safe place so they can be used in a court case against the people who were arrested. The cash and other items that are seized may also be used as evidence in the court case, or they may be returned to their rightful owner if it is determined that they were not involved in the illegal activity. If the items are not needed as evidence, they may be destroyed or sold, with the money going to the government.<>reddit_eli5
