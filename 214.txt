Acupuncture How does it work ? What is the basis behind it ? How can shoving needles into specific points on your body help cure pain that people are suffering from ? Or is all of it just a relic of ancient Chinese Medicine ? Explain like I'm five.<>It does n't work . It 's been demonstrated that acupuncture is no more effective than sticking needles in random places , and if people did n't know acupuncture was * supposed * to work sticking needles in random places might not do anything either . It 's entirely just a relic of ancient Chinese medicine .<>Acupuncture is a type of traditional Chinese medicine that involves inserting very thin needles into specific points on the body. Practitioners of acupuncture believe that these points correspond to energy pathways in the body called meridians. They believe that inserting needles into these points can help to restore balance to the flow of energy in the body and promote healing. There are many different theories about how acupuncture works, but one of the main theories is that it helps to stimulate the release of certain chemicals in the body, such as endorphins, which can help to reduce pain and improve overall health. Some studies have shown that acupuncture may be effective in relieving certain types of pain, such as low back pain, neck pain, and osteoarthritis. It's important to note that acupuncture is just one form of treatment and may not work for everyone. It's always a good idea to talk to a healthcare provider before starting any new treatment.<>reddit_eli5
