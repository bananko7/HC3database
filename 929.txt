- Why is the human period cycle 28 days ? I 've heard it has something to do with the moon , but what ? Hoping for a little science \/ biology in the answer as well . Metaphysics will definitely get my down - votes . Please explain like I'm five.<>So far as we know , there 's no relationship between the moon and the menstrual cycle . It 's a coincidence . There 's some indication it might be an evolutionary hold - over . In some species ( ex . lemurs ) , sex occurs around the time of the full moon . There has n't been much conclusive evidence that this occurs in humans , so far as I 'm aware .<>The human menstrual cycle, which is the period that most people are referring to when they say \"period cycle,\" is typically around 28 days long. This is the time it takes for the body to go through the various changes and stages that are necessary for pregnancy to occur. \nThe menstrual cycle is regulated by hormones produced by the body. These hormones, called estrogen and progesterone, help to control the growth and development of the uterine lining (the endometrium) and the release of an egg from the ovary (ovulation). \nThe length of the menstrual cycle can vary from person to person, but 28 days is considered to be the average length. There are many factors that can affect the length of the menstrual cycle, including stress, illness, certain medications, and changes in diet or exercise. \nThe idea that the menstrual cycle is related to the moon is a myth. The moon has no direct effect on the menstrual cycle, although some people may experience changes in their cycle due to the body's natural circadian rhythms, which can be influenced by changes in light and darkness.<>reddit_eli5
