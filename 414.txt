if dinosaurs and other long extinct mammals were so massive , why then are their evolutionary descendants so small ? Like velociraptors Please explain like I'm five.<>Being big requires a lot of energy and resources . So in a time when resources were scarce , being able to get by while being smaller was of an evolutionary benefit .<>Dinosaurs and other extinct animals were often much larger than their modern-day descendants because they lived in a different time period and had different environmental conditions. For example, dinosaurs lived during a time when there was more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which may have contributed to their larger size. In addition, the earth was warmer during the time of the dinosaurs, which may have also played a role in their size. It's also important to note that not all dinosaurs were massive. Some dinosaurs, like velociraptors, were actually relatively small compared to other species. Velociraptors were about the size of a turkey, while some other species of dinosaurs were much larger, such as the brontosaurus, which could grow to be over 100 feet long. Overall, the size of an animal can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the environment they live in, the resources they have available, and the pressures they face from other animals and their surroundings.<>reddit_eli5
