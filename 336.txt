Why are beds so expensive ? It seems like a decent queen or king size mattress and box spring set costs over $ 1,000 . It does n't seem like they are complicated enough to warrant that high of a price , am I missing something ? Explain like I'm five.<>To be fair , I 'd spend a lot of money on something I 'd spending half of my day on top of<>Beds can be expensive because they are made of high-quality materials and are designed to be comfortable and last for a long time. The cost of the materials, labor, and other expenses that go into making a bed can add up, which can make the final price of the bed seem high. It's also important to remember that beds are an important part of our daily lives and are something that we use every day, so people are willing to spend more money on a bed that they know will be comfortable and durable. So, while it might seem like a lot of money at first, a good bed can be worth it in the long run.<>reddit_eli5
