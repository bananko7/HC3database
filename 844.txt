Why is the NEA against school vouchers ? Question says it all Explain like I'm five. <>NEA is for public school teachers Voucher program will result in more private schools reducing member rates and therefore lowering union dues . Their spoken reason though is they think that voucher program will encourage private schools will raise the cost of education and sacrifice the quality of education .<>The National Education Association (NEA) is a professional organization for educators in the United States. They represent public school teachers, education support professionals, and higher education faculty and staff.\\n\\nThe NEA is opposed to school vouchers because they believe that vouchers take resources away from public schools and give them to private schools. Public schools are funded by taxpayers, and vouchers allow some of that funding to go towards tuition at private schools instead. This can lead to less funding for public schools, which can make it harder for them to provide a high-quality education for all students.\\n\\nThe NEA also believes that vouchers may not be the best solution for improving education, and that there are other ways to improve schools that do not involve taking resources away from them. They believe that public schools should be fully funded and supported so that all students can receive a high-quality education.\\n\\nI hope this helps to explain why the NEA is against school vouchers. Let me know if you have any other questions!<>reddit_eli5
