Why ca n't I harm anyone in dreams ? Punching and kicking are either in slow motion or I find myself unable to move properly . Even shooting , I find myself struggling pulling the trigger . Explain like I'm five.<>The way I had it explained to me once was that people that are very confident in themselves and their abilities have no problem overcoming obstacles ( like conflicts of that nature ) in dreams . People that lack that confidence will not be able to win battles in their dreams , and it can manifest in being too slow to hit the other people \/ things , too weak to do damage , etc . That being said , dream interpretation is far from an exact science . That analogy seems to hold true for me and the people I 've talked to , but it 's not likely to be universally true .<>In dreams, your body is actually paralyzed and unable to move, which is why it might feel like you are struggling to move or that your movements are in slow motion. This is a natural defense mechanism that helps protect your body from harm while you are asleep.\r\n\r\nIn your dreams, your mind creates a simulated reality that you experience as if it were real. However, because it is just a simulation, you are not actually able to physically harm anyone or anything in the real world.\r\n\r\nSo, even though it might feel like you are punching or kicking someone in your dream, your body is actually just lying still and the dream is just a story that your mind is creating.<>reddit_eli5
