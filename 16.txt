How do ice cubes work on a molecular level to lower the temperature of the liquid around them ? Also : Is there an upper limit to this cooling ? Please explain like I'm five.
Heat flows from the object with higher temperature to the object with lower temperature . The liquid around the cubes is hotter , therefore it will deposit heat into the cubes and lower its own temperature as a result . Also , the cubes will gain that heat , and start to melt . So : I believe you 're thinking of this the wrong way . The ice cubes do nothing other than \" being cold \" . There is no chemical process involved . One caveat is that ice absorbs a lot of heat to melt , so it works better than , say , a chilled cube of metal , which would warm up fast without cooling the drink much .
Sure! When you put an ice cube in a drink, the ice absorbs heat from the drink. This happens because heat always flows from warmer things to cooler things.On a molecular level, the molecules in the ice are moving around very slowly, because they are cold. When the ice absorbs heat from the drink, the heat causes the molecules in the ice to start moving around faster. As the molecules in the ice start moving faster, the ice starts to melt and turn into water.As the ice melts and turns into water, it absorbs more heat from the drink. This helps to cool the drink down even more.There is an upper limit to how much the ice can cool the drink. Once the ice has melted completely and turned into water, it can't absorb any more heat. At this point, the temperature of the ice water will be the same as the temperature of the drink.I hope that helps to explain how ice cubes work to cool things down! Do you have any other questions?
