Why do we see colours and ' stars ' when we close our eyes ? What is the brain doing that makes us see the random swirling colours and spots when we close our eyes but are still awake ? Explain like I'm five.<>That 's what we call \" visual snow . \" In your visual nervous system , there is a small baseline level of neurological activity going on , even when you 're not getting a stimulus . Basically it 's just random firing of a few neurons here and there . Usually this activity is washed out by all the visual information you 're getting from your eyes . Think of it like a radio that 's just a tiny bit out of tune . Normally , when the music is playing , you would n't hear the small amount of static that 's there . Once the music stops , however , you can hear the static . It 's the same thing with your eyes . When you close your eyes , you 've eliminated the external stimulus ( the \" music \" ) , and all that 's left is the baseline neurological activity ( the \" static \" ) .<>When you close your eyes, the inside of your eyelids becomes the only source of light that your eyes can see. But because your eyelids are not a very bright source of light, they don't produce very much light at all.\r\n\r\nAs a result, your eyes don't have much to look at, and your brain starts to fill in the missing information. This is a process called \"filling in,\" and it's what happens when your brain tries to make sense of incomplete or ambiguous information.\r\n\r\nThe colours and patterns that you see when you close your eyes are called \"phosphenes,\" and they are created by your brain as it tries to fill in the missing information. Phosphenes can be many different colours, and they can appear as swirling patterns, spots, or even shapes.\r\n\r\nSo, when you close your eyes and see colours and patterns, it's not that your eyes are actually seeing those things. It's just your brain trying to make sense of the lack of visual input by creating its own patterns and colours.<>reddit_eli5
