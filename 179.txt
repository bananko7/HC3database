Difference between net - worth and how much money you actually have . For example Carlos Slim Helu 's net worth is at $ 73 billion , does he actually have 73 billion dollars or how does it work ? Explain like I'm five.<>Net worth is the combined value of an individual 's assets subtracted by his debts . Members of the middle class who have saved several thousand dollars wo n't have a net worth of several grand if they owe more on their student loans , cars , house . If you owe more than your assets are worth , your net worth is negative . In the examples of very wealthy people , net worth is not the total cash they have on hand . It 's the combined value of their homes , cars , boats , stocks , bonds and other assets . Liquid ( spendable ) currency is just one part .<>A person's net worth is the total value of all their assets, such as cash, stocks, and property, minus any debts they owe. So, if someone has a net worth of $73 billion, that means the total value of everything they own is worth $73 billion after you subtract any debts they have.\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that a person's net worth is not the same as the amount of cash they have on hand. For example, someone might have a lot of stocks, property, and other assets that are worth a lot of money, but they might not have much cash available to spend. On the other hand, someone might have a lower net worth because they don't have many assets, but they might have a lot of cash saved up.\r\n\r\nSo, to answer your question, Carlos Slim Helu's net worth of $73 billion does not necessarily mean that he has $73 billion in cash, but rather that the total value of all his assets is worth $73 billion.<>reddit_eli5
