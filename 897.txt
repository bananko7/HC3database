Why do humans naturally like 4 bar music rhythms ? Why not 5 bars , or 7 ? Is there something fundamentally \" right \" about the number 4 that makes it musically appealing ? Please explain like I'm five.<>I read something a while back about people liking familiarity , which is why a lot of popular music ( and also things like movie plots ) Follow a similar structure . Each is different enough to not bore us however familiar in a way people find comfortable . Think about the number of songs with the same 4\/4 4 chord progression structure . People eat that up !<>The reason why 4-bar rhythms are common in music is that they feel natural and easy to follow. 4-bar rhythms are found in many different types of music from all over the world, and they have been used for centuries. \nOne reason why 4-bar rhythms might be particularly appealing is that they divide the music into manageable chunks. When you listen to a song with a 4-bar rhythm, it's easy to follow along and tap your foot or clap your hands to the beat. \nAnother reason is that 4-bar rhythms are very flexible. Musicians can easily add or subtract beats, change the tempo, or change the arrangement of the music within a 4-bar structure, which gives them a lot of creative freedom. \nThere isn't anything inherently \"right\" about the number 4 when it comes to music. Different cultures and musical traditions have their own rhythmic structures, and some of them use rhythms that are based on 5, 7, or other numbers of beats. Ultimately, what makes a rhythm appealing is how it feels to the listener and how it fits with the other elements of the music.<>reddit_eli5
