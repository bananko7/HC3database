How is time an illusion ? I 'm having difficulties wrapping my mind around the concept of timelessness . Explain like I'm five.
Time is a measurement based on the scale in which humans live and die . This is also reflected in the way we distinguish time given the orbit of Earth around the sun , the constellations and so forth . Having said that , observing something like say an asteroid , comet , or an entire galaxy have such a huge and nearly incomprehensible \" lifespan \" ( for lack of a better term ) , time as we know it is essentially meaningless . To call it an illusion is a bit unfair . I like to think of it as a measurement or a reference point
Time is a concept that we use to measure the duration of events and the order in which they occur. It is a way of keeping track of the past, present, and future. However, some people believe that time is an illusion because it is a human-made concept and does not exist in the same way that physical objects or events do.\r\n\r\nImagine you are playing a game with a group of friends. The game has rules, and you keep track of how long it takes to complete each round. You might say, \"It took me three minutes to finish this round.\" But the time it takes to complete a round is not an inherent property of the game itself. It is a way of measuring something using a human-made concept.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, time is a way of measuring the duration of events and the order in which they occur, but it is not an inherent property of the universe. Some scientists and philosophers believe that the concept of time is a human invention and that it may not exist in the same way that we experience it.\r\n\r\nSo in this way, time could be considered an illusion because it is a concept that we use to understand and describe the world around us, but it is not a fundamental part of the universe itself.
