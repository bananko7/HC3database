Why are so many major US cities located on state borders ? Kansas City , St Louis , Memphis , Cincinnati , Omaha , the list goes on ... Please explain like I'm five.<>This is purely a guess , but I 'd say because most cities are near bodies of water and many state borders are formed by rivers .<>Many major cities in the United States are located on state borders for a variety of reasons. One reason is that these cities often developed around transportation hubs, such as rivers or railways, which made it easier for people and goods to move between different states. For example, the city of St. Louis is located on the Mississippi River, which was an important transportation route for people and goods in the 19th century. Similarly, Kansas City is located near the confluence of the Missouri and Kansas Rivers, and Omaha is located on the Missouri River.Another reason that some cities are located on state borders is that they were founded as border towns between two states. For example, the city of Cincinnati was founded in 1788, when the state of Ohio was still a part of the Northwest Territory. The city was located on the border between Ohio and the state of Kentucky, which was still a part of Virginia at the time.Finally, some cities are located on state borders because they have grown to include areas from both states. For example, the city of Memphis is located on the border between the states of Tennessee and Mississippi, and it has grown to include parts of both states.Overall, the location of major cities on state borders can be influenced by a combination of transportation routes, historical and political factors, and the growth and expansion of the cities over time.<>reddit_eli5
