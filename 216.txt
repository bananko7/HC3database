What do the radical Islamists have against education for women ? Simply put , why are they so against womens education ? And in light of the recent hostage situation in Nigeria , how can these groups rationalize that what they are doing is right ? Explain like I'm five.<>A dumb person is easier to control ?<>Radical Islamists are a small group of people who have a very strict and extreme interpretation of Islam. They believe that men and women should have very different roles in society, and they think that education is not important for women because they believe that women should only be responsible for taking care of the home and family. They might also believe that if women are educated, they will not be as obedient to their husbands.\r\n\r\nThe hostage situation in Nigeria you mentioned is a very serious and tragic event, and it is not right for anyone to harm or threaten other people. It is important for all people to respect the rights and safety of others, no matter what their beliefs are. It is not okay to use violence or intimidation to try to force others to believe what you believe.<>reddit_eli5
