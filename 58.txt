Nuclear waste is the material that is left over after nuclear fuel has been used in a nuclear power plant or other type of nuclear facility. It is highly radioactive and can be dangerous to people and the environment if it is not properly handled and disposed of.\\n\\nThere are several ways to get rid of nuclear waste safely, and the method that is used depends on the type of waste and the regulations in the country where the waste is being disposed of. Here are a few examples of how nuclear waste is safely disposed of:\\n\\nBurying it in the ground: One way to get rid of nuclear waste is to bury it in the ground in a special container called a \"drum.\" The drum is made of thick, strong material that can hold the waste and keep it from escaping. The drum is then placed in a hole in the ground and covered with dirt.\\n\\nStoring it in a special facility: Another way to get rid of nuclear waste is to store it in a special facility called a \"repository.\" A repository is a building or underground storage area that is designed specifically for storing nuclear waste. The waste is placed in special containers and stored in the repository until it can be safely disposed of.\\n\\nSending it to another country: In some cases, nuclear waste may be sent to another country where it can be safely disposed of. This is usually done by shipping the waste in special containers on a boat or plane. The waste is then delivered to the other country and disposed of according to the laws and regulations of that country.\\n\\nOverall, there are several ways to get rid of nuclear waste safely, including burying it in the ground, storing it in a special facility, or sending it to another country. It is important to follow proper procedures and use special equipment to ensure that the waste is handled and disposed of safely.\\n<>reddit_eli5
