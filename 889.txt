The holy trinity God , Jesus , and the Holy Spirit . Are they the same thing ? Seperate ? Please explain like I'm five.<>They are the same thing , yet different . Each one is an aspect of God in their own right , but all together form the grand picture of what God truly is . The Father ( sometimes called the Creator ) is the idea of God as a leader , as a creator , that he is the one who created everything and we , humans , are his children and should follow him . The Son ( Jesus ) is the idea of God on Earth , as a man . That we are truly in his image and that he would sacrifice a part of himself for our souls . The Holy Spirit ( sometimes Holy Ghost ) is the idea of God as an ethereal and global force . Not as some man in the clouds , but as a force of the universe like gravity , or heat . When people say \" God is everywhere \" this is what they mean , the Holy Spirit is everywhere , all around us , essentially acting like the Force from Star Wars .<>The Holy Trinity is a concept in Christianity that refers to the three persons of the one God: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Spirit. These three persons are separate and distinct, but they are also one and the same in terms of their divine nature and their unity in purpose. \nTo help understand this concept, it can be helpful to think of water, which can exist in three different forms: as a solid (ice), a liquid (water), and a gas (steam). Just as ice, water, and steam are all different forms of the same substance (water), the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are different persons of the one God. \nAnother way to think about the Holy Trinity is to consider the different roles that each person plays in the Christian faith. God the Father is the creator of the universe and is often seen as the ultimate authority. Jesus Christ is the Son of God and is believed to be the savior of humanity. The Holy Spirit is the spirit of God that is present in the world and in the lives of believers, helping them to understand and follow God's will. \nOverall, it's important to remember that the Holy Trinity is a mystery that goes beyond human understanding. While it can be helpful to try to understand the concept in different ways, it's ultimately something that is beyond our full comprehension.<>reddit_eli5
