RegardsDr.Saranya Ramadoss, General and Family Physician<>It's generally safe to take Lactare capsules while breastfeeding, as they contain lactose and other ingredients that are thought to be safe for nursing mothers and their infants. However, it's always important to be cautious when taking any medication, even if it's available over the counter. It's always a good idea to talk to your healthcare provider before starting any new medication, including Lactare capsules, to make sure it's appropriate for you and your baby.\n\nThere is limited information available on the long-term safety of taking Lactare capsules, as they are not intended for long-term use. It's generally recommended to use them for a short period of time to help improve milk production, rather than continuing to take them for an extended period.\n\nIf you have any concerns about the safety of taking Lactare capsules or any other medication while breastfeeding, it's important to discuss them with your healthcare provider. They can help you weigh the potential risks and benefits and make an informed decision that's best for you and your baby.<>medicine
