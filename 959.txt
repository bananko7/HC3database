Why do so many British actors get cast in roles as Americans but Americans playing Brits is almost unheard of ? Yes I 'm aware of Brad Pitt in Snatch . Please explain like I'm five.<>It 's not unheard of at all , it happens all the time . Ever see * The Lord of the Rings * ? Elijah Wood , Viggo Mortensen , Sean Astin , Liv Tyler , Hugo Weaving ( Australian ) all playing vaguely British - sounding characters . How about Natalie Portman in * V For Vendetta * ? RDJ in * Sherlock Holmes * ? * Bridget Jones â€™ Diary * ? The cast of * This Is Spinal Tap ? * Johnny Depp in every other movie he 's in ?<>There are a few reasons why British actors might get cast in American roles more often than American actors get cast in British roles. One reason is that the entertainment industry is based in the United States, and so there are more opportunities for actors to audition for American roles. Additionally, the United States has a larger film and television industry overall, so there are simply more roles available for actors to audition for. Another reason is that British actors are often seen as highly trained and versatile, with many of them having received classical theater training at prestigious schools like the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London. This means that they are able to play a wide range of characters and accents, including American ones. Finally, it could also be the case that British actors are simply more popular in the United States, and so they are more likely to be cast in American roles.<>reddit_eli5
