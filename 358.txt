How do electrical instruments work ? Tempted to give my character an electrical voilin for a D & D campaign but i do n't really know enough about how they work . how does it change sound , and would running a current through a voilin be enough ? Explain like I'm five. <>No . Electrical musical instruments work by having magnetic pickups which output a signal based on the frequency of the vibrating metal string . This output current is then amplified and converted into sound by the amplifier .<>An electric violin is a musical instrument that uses electricity to amplify the sound of the strings. It works by using a pickup, which is a small device that converts the vibrations of the strings into an electrical signal. The pickup is usually located under the strings, near the bridge of the violin.\\n\\nThe electrical signal from the pickup is then sent to an amplifier, which makes the sound louder. The amplifier can also be used to shape the sound by adjusting the tone and adding effects like reverb or echo.\\n\\nTo play an electric violin, the musician uses a bow to draw across the strings, just like with a traditional violin. The strings vibrate and create sound waves, which are picked up by the pickup and converted into an electrical signal. The amplifier then amplifies the signal and sends it to a speaker, which converts the electrical signal back into sound waves that we can hear.\\n\\nRunning a current through a violin would not be enough to make sound on its own. The pickup and amplifier are needed to convert the vibrations of the strings into an electrical signal and amplify it. However, it is possible to use electricity to create sound in other ways, such as with an electric guitar or synthesizer.<>reddit_eli5
