Cellular Automata to a non - CS major I really want to understand Cellular Automata . I am a science major and I think it has general application in simulation of interconnected systems such as crystals , networks etc . Explain like I'm five.
Cellular automata are cells -- little boxes -- like in MS Excel or tic - tac - toe , that can be black or white , and change over time . You could play with cellular automata with a pencil and a sheet of grid paper if you wanted to . After you set things up , coloring certain cells black and leaving other ones white however you want , you get to draw the next step of your grid . Imagine this as the second turn in a game that you 're playing with the boxes . There are rules ( and you can make your own up ) , about which boxes should be white and which ones should be black on this turn . Your rules could be simple . If you wanted , you could make a rule that if the box was white during the last turn , the box to the left of it has to be black this turn . Then you can take a third turn , and a fourth , and so on , using your same rules . Lots of people have made up lots of different rules . It would be a pretty boring game to play with graph paper , because you 'd have no control , except when you made up the rules . The rest of the time , you 'd just be watching the patterns that your rules made . What 's interesting ( or what 's interesting to me ) about cellular automata , is that very simple rules make things happen that seem very complicated . Simple rules can make it seem like there are living things moving around and interacting with each other , like in [ Conway 's Game of Life ] ( URL_1 ) . Also , sometimes you can see patterns that look like the same ones you can find in flowers and sea shells and all over nature . Some people think that cellular automata are interesting because they show us that complicated things can come from very simple rules . At least one really smart person , [ Stephen Wolfram ] ( URL_0 ) , thinks that maybe the whole world is really just a system of cellular automata , and probably one with really simple rules . In some very important math software that Mr. Wolfram made , cellular automata are used ( if I remember right ) to come up with random numbers . Of course , they could n't really be random , since they 're being found using those rules ! But if Mr. Wolfram is right , maybe nothing is really random . There are probably a lot of interesting things about cellular automata that I do n't know about . But these are the things that I 've heard about them that I think are really interesting .
Sure! A cellular automaton is a system made up of a grid of cells, each of which can be in one of a set of states (for example, \"on\" or \"off\"). The cells change their state over time based on a set of rules that depend on the state of the cells around them.\n\nImagine a row of light bulbs, each of which can be either on or off. The state of a light bulb at a given time depends on the state of the light bulbs next to it. For example, we might say that a light bulb will turn on if both of the light bulbs next to it are on, and it will turn off if either of the light bulbs next to it is off.\n\nWe can think of each light bulb as a cell in a grid, and the rules we just described as the \"rules\" of the cellular automaton. By applying these rules to each cell in the grid over and over again, we can simulate how the system changes over time.\n\nCellular automata are used to model a wide variety of systems, including biological and physical systems. They are especially useful for studying how patterns and structures emerge in complex systems.
