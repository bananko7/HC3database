Why are some diseases or conditions \" endemic \" to only certain areas ? Why does location matter ? Also , why do outbreaks seem to be cyclical , for example , major ones occurring every 2 or 3 years ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Q1 : Location matters because many diseases have \" resevoirs \" , that is , other life forms that complete part of the life cycle but is not adversely affected by the pathogen . I assume you 're referring to the recent Ebola outbreak in Africa . Ebola is endemic to Africa because it needs certain African bat species to survive . Q2 : Mostly because of awareness . An outbreak happens , people freak out , two years later they forget , and another outbreak happens .<>There are many factors that can contribute to why certain diseases or conditions are more common in certain areas. One reason is that the conditions in those areas may be more favorable for the disease to spread. For example, a certain type of mosquito may be more prevalent in one area, and that mosquito could carry and transmit a disease like malaria. Another reason could be that people in certain areas may not have access to the same level of healthcare as people in other areas, which could make them more vulnerable to getting sick. As for why outbreaks can be cyclical, this can also be due to a variety of factors. For example, the weather can play a role, as certain diseases may be more common during certain seasons. Additionally, the way that people live and interact with each other can also contribute to the spread of disease. For example, if a lot of people are crowded together in a small space, it can be easier for a disease to spread from person to person.<>reddit_eli5
