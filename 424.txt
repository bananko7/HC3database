Please explain what is \"Navier–Stokes equations\"<>In physics, the Navier–Stokes equations (\/nævˈjeɪ stoʊks\/ nav-YAY STOHKS) are partial differential equations which describe the motion of viscous fluid substances, named after French engineer and physicist Claude-Louis Navier and Anglo-Irish physicist and mathematician George Gabriel Stokes.  They were developed over several decades of progressively building the theories, from 1822 (Navier) to 1842–1850 (Stokes).\nThe Navier–Stokes equations mathematically express conservation of momentum and conservation of mass for Newtonian fluids. They are sometimes accompanied by an equation of state relating pressure, temperature  and density. They arise from applying Isaac Newton's second law to fluid motion, together with the assumption that the stress in the fluid is the sum of a diffusing viscous term (proportional to the gradient of velocity) and a pressure term—hence describing viscous flow. The difference between them and the closely related Euler equations is that Navier–Stokes equations take viscosity into account while the Euler equations model only inviscid flow. As a result, the Navier–Stokes are a parabolic equation and therefore have better analytic properties, at the expense of having less mathematical structure (e.g. they are never completely integrable).\nThe Navier–Stokes equations are useful because they describe the physics of many phenomena of scientific and engineering interest. They may be used to model the weather, ocean currents, water flow in a pipe and air flow around a wing. The Navier–Stokes equations, in their full and simplified forms, help with the design of aircraft and cars, the study of blood flow, the design of power stations, the analysis of pollution, and many other things. Coupled with Maxwell's equations, they can be used to model and study magnetohydrodynamics.\nThe Navier–Stokes equations are also of great interest in a purely mathematical sense. Despite their wide range of practical uses, it has not yet been proven whether smooth solutions always exist in three dimensions—i.e., whether they are infinitely differentiable (or even just bounded) at all points in the domain. This is called the Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness problem. The Clay Mathematics Institute has called this one of the seven most important open problems in mathematics and has offered a US$1 million prize for a solution or a counterexample.<>The Navier-Stokes equations are a set of mathematical equations that describe the motion of fluids, such as gases and liquids. They are named after French engineer and physicist Claude-Louis Navier and Anglo-Irish scientist George Gabriel Stokes.\n\n\n\nThe equations describe how the velocity, pressure, and other properties of a fluid are related and how they change over time. They are used to predict the behavior of fluids in a wide range of applications, including aerodynamics, meteorology, and the design of airplane wings and engines, as well as the flow of blood in the human body and the behavior of oceans and rivers.\n\n\n\nThe Navier-Stokes equations are based on the principles of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. They take the form of a set of coupled partial differential equations that must be solved simultaneously in order to accurately predict the motion of a fluid.\n\n\n\nSolving the Navier-Stokes equations is a challenging task, and it is an active area of research in mathematics and engineering. Despite their widespread use and importance, there are still many aspects of fluid dynamics that are not fully understood and that remain the subject of ongoing research.<>wiki_csai
