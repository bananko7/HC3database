How can we not yet replicate the composition of expensive aged drinks like old Whiskey and Cognac If it all comes down to chemistry , and there are some burnt oak traces and such ... Should nt it all be reverse engineerable at this point in time ? Explain like I'm five.<>Which would you rather have ? An autographed original rookie babe Ruth baseball card ? Or a replica ? Which would you rather pay more for ? Could some whiskey be made in sped up fashion to replicate an aged 100 year old product ? Maybe . Do the type of trees used still exist ? Do the types of crops , growing conditions and distillery still exist ? Will people pay for a replica ? Or is the age , rarity and brand value important ?<>\\nAged drinks like whiskey and cognac are made by using a specific process that involves the use of certain ingredients and techniques. One of the key ingredients in these drinks is oak, which is used to age the liquid and give it its unique flavor. The process of aging the liquid involves storing it in oak barrels for a certain period of time, which allows the flavors to develop and mature.\\n\\nThe reason it is difficult to replicate the exact composition of these aged drinks is that there are many factors that can affect the final product, including the type of oak used, the length of time the liquid is aged, the temperature and humidity of the storage environment, and the type of liquid being aged. These factors can all contribute to the final flavor and character of the drink, and it can be challenging to replicate the exact combination of factors that results in a particular aged drink.\\n\\nIn addition to the factors mentioned above, the process of aging a drink also involves chemical reactions that occur over time, which can also contribute to the final flavor and character of the drink. While it may be possible to reverse engineer some of these processes, it would be a complex and time-consuming task, and it would be difficult to replicate the exact flavor of an aged drink without access to the original ingredients and techniques used in its production.<>reddit_eli5
