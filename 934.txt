How are plastic microbeads in facial washes and soap so much more dangerous than sand , which is already common in lakes and oceans ? Also pumice and ground peach pits , which we 've been putting in soap for decades ? Please explain like I'm five.<>It 's not the size of the beads that 's the direct problem , it 's what they 're made out of . Ingesting plastic can lead to hormonal changes and other impacts that do n't happen when ingesting those other things . In a sentence : Plastic is toxic , pumice , peach pits , and sand are n't .<>Plastic microbeads are harmful to the environment because they are very small and can easily get into the water supply. Once they are in the water, they can be eaten by fish and other marine animals. When the animals eat the microbeads, they can get sick or even die. Sand, pumice, and ground peach pits are natural materials that are not harmful to the environment in the same way. They are biodegradable, which means they can be broken down by natural processes into materials that are not harmful. Plastic microbeads do not break down easily and can stay in the environment for a very long time, causing problems for a long time.<>reddit_eli5
