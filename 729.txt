Why are gas prices so high even though the US is producing the most it has in over two decades ? Source : URL_0 Explain like I'm five.<>That 's a loaded question , but on an ELI5 level : Higher domestic production is just one small piece of the supply and demand curves that dictate gas pricing . Other factors , particularly supply of imported crude ( which accounts for a very large percentage - 40 - 70 % depeneding on who you want to cite - of petroleum product in the US ) , rapidly increasing global demand and a complicated regulatory system all contribute to pump ( ha ! ) the price higher . Also worth noting that gas in the US is still cheaper by volume than most of the world .<>There are a few reasons why gas prices might be high even though the US is producing a lot of oil.\r\n\r\nOne reason is that the cost of producing oil has gone up. This means that it costs more for companies to get the oil out of the ground and turn it into gasoline.\r\n\r\nAnother reason is that the demand for oil and gasoline is high. This means that more people are using gasoline, which can make the price go up.\r\n\r\nFinally, the price of gasoline is also influenced by the cost of transportation. If it costs a lot to transport gasoline to where it is needed, then the price of gasoline might be higher.\r\n\r\nOverall, there are many factors that can influence the price of gasoline, and it is not always easy to understand why the price is high or low.<>reddit_eli5
