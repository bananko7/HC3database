How can charcoal burn when it 's made from from burnt wood ? Should n't all the innate energy already have been used up during the initial combustion leaving you with material equivalent in flammability to ash . Explain like I'm five. <>Charcoal is n't burned wood . It is produced by heating the wood in an oxygen free environment , which prevents it from burning . The heat causes liquids and gases to be expelled from the wood , leaving a solid residue that is made up mostly of carbon , which is more combustible than plain wood .<>Charcoal is made by heating wood in a low oxygen environment. This process, called pyrolysis, removes water and volatile compounds from the wood, leaving behind a material that is mostly carbon. Because the volatile compounds have been removed, charcoal does not burn as easily as wood.\\n\\nHowever, when you expose charcoal to oxygen, it can catch fire and burn. This is because the carbon in the charcoal is still able to react with the oxygen in the air to produce heat, light, and other products of combustion.\\n\\nThink of it like this: when you burn wood, you are using up the energy stored in the wood. But when you make charcoal, you are removing some of the energy from the wood and storing it in the charcoal. When you burn the charcoal, you are releasing that stored energy.<>reddit_eli5
