Why does n't rain seriously harm us when it falls from the sky ? Should n't gravity cause objects to fall with increasing speed ? Is there something about rain that prevents it from causing us any serious injury ? Explain like I'm five.<>Gravity does cause things to fall with increasing speed , but as they speed up air resistance increases ( think of sticking your hand out the window while driving 10 mph vs 60 mph ) . Eventually the force of the air resistance is enough to balance the force of gravity , so the acceleration stops and the raindrop reaches terminal velocity . Apparently the terminal velocity of rain is n't high enough to cause damage . F = MxA so the force required to stop the raindrop would n't be that much because 1 . a raindrop does n't have a lot of mass 2 . it 's speed is n't that high 3 . it 's liquid<>​\r\n\r\n\r\n···\r\nChatGPT Dec 15 Version.
