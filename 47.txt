If you left a piece of steak by itself in space , would it rot ? In case the title is confusing : If placed in a vacuum , would raw meat turn bad or would it stay perfectly edible ? What factors would play into this ? Explain like I'm five.<>Some bacteria need very little to live . Any of these bacteria already living in the meat would be able to decompose some of it , for a little while . However , the small percentage of these bacteria , coupled with the * extreme * coldness of space would make any such decomposition virtually unnoticeable . More importantly , the water in the meat would boil from the low pressure and the steak would essentially become freeze - dried . Could you eat it ? ... .... .... probably .<>If you left a piece of raw steak in a vacuum, it would not rot because there would be no bacteria or other microorganisms present to cause the process of rotting to occur. However, the vacuum would cause the steak to dry out and lose moisture, which would make it tough and inedible.\r\n\r\nRotting occurs when bacteria and other microorganisms break down the tissues of a food item, causing it to decompose and release a foul odor. This process requires the presence of oxygen and moisture, both of which are necessary for the microorganisms to grow and reproduce. In the absence of these conditions, the steak would not rot.\r\n\r\nSo, to answer your question, raw meat placed in a vacuum would not rot, but it would become inedible due to the lack of moisture.<>If you left a piece of raw steak in a vacuum, it would not rot because there would be no bacteria or other microorganisms present to cause the process of rotting to occur.
