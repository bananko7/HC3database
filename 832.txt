When you 're trying to go to sleep and you can feel something that resembles ' bugs ' crawling over you , but there are no bugs . Freaks me out ! Explain like I'm five.<>Finally something I can answer . When you are laying down and trying to sleep ( usually in the dark and silence ) your body becomes more aware . With this new heightened sense of perception you start to notice what you have nt before . The \" bugs \" you feel are actually not quite bugs , but close enough . They are just a bit more microscopic , beings that live on and in you , your body is an ecosystem . Are you surprised things live off of it ? Do nt worry , they wo nt harm you ;)<>Sometimes, when we are trying to go to sleep, we can feel sensations on our skin that feel like bugs crawling over us, but there are no actual bugs present. This sensation is called \"formication,\" and it can be caused by a variety of things. It could be a side effect of certain medications, or it could be a symptom of certain medical conditions, such as nerve damage or skin irritation. It could also be caused by stress or anxiety, or it could simply be a strange sensation that our brains create for no apparent reason. If you are experiencing formication and it is causing you distress, you may want to speak with a healthcare professional to discuss the possible causes and see if there is anything that can be done to help.<>reddit_eli5
