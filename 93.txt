Please explain what is \"Computer graphics\"
Computer graphics deals with generating images with the aid of computers. Today, computer graphics is a core technology in digital photography, film, video games, cell phone and computer displays, and many specialized applications. A great deal of specialized hardware and software has been developed, with the displays of most devices being driven by computer graphics hardware. It is a vast and recently developed area of computer science. The phrase was coined in 1960 by computer graphics researchers Verne Hudson and William Fetter of Boeing. It is often abbreviated as CG, or typically in the context of film as computer generated imagery (CGI). The non-artistic aspects of computer graphics are the subject of computer science research.\nSome topics in computer graphics include user interface design, sprite graphics, rendering, ray tracing, geometry processing, computer animation, vector graphics, 3D modeling, shaders, GPU design, implicit surfaces, visualization, scientific computing, image processing, computational photography, scientific visualization, computational geometry and computer vision, among others. The overall methodology depends heavily on the underlying sciences of geometry, optics, physics, and perception.\nComputer graphics is responsible for displaying art and image data effectively and meaningfully to the consumer. It is also used for processing image data received from the physical world, such as photo and video content. Computer graphics development has had a significant impact on many types of media and has revolutionized animation, movies, advertising, video games, in general.
Computer graphics are visual representations of data that are generated by a computer using specialized software. These graphics can be static, like a digital photograph, or they can be dynamic, like a video game or a movie.\n\n\n\nComputer graphics are used in a wide variety of fields, including art, science, engineering, and medicine. They are used to create visualizations of complex data sets, to design and model products and structures, and to create entertainment content such as video games and movies.\n\n\n\nThere are several different types of computer graphics, including raster graphics and vector graphics. Raster graphics are made up of pixels, which are tiny squares of color that make up the overall image. Vector graphics, on the other hand, are made up of lines and shapes that are defined mathematically, which allows them to be scaled up or down without losing quality.\n\n\n\nComputer graphics can be created using a variety of software programs, including 2D and 3D graphics editors, computer-aided design (CAD) software, and game development engines. These programs allow users to create, edit, and manipulate graphics using a wide range of tools and features, such as brushes, filters, layers, and 3D modeling tools.
