A question about Key Signatures . How are A major and F#m the same key signature ? How do I know the relation ? Explain like I'm five.<>If you play an A major scale on a piano , it goes : A B C # D E F # G # ( you 'll notice this includes on of each letter ) . [ It looks like this ] ( URL_1 ) If you play an F # minor scale on a piano , it goes : F # G # A B C # D E ( also one of each letter ) [ It looks like this ] ( URL_2 ) The key signature takes each letter ( or ' note ' ) and tells you whether to leave is as is ( natural ) or flatten it or sharpen it . In a major , the sharps on the C , F and G tells you to sharpen those three notes . In a F # minor key signature , it does the same . We can see the reason why by superimposing our A major scale on our F # minor scale : [ Like this ] ( URL_0 ) You 'll see that whilst the notes are the same , since there are more than one of each note ( called different ' pitches ' ) , the starting position , has moved down a minor third ( or 3 semitones ) . So whilst the key signature takes into account all the sharps and flats , it does not take into account the starting note ( or ' root note ' or ' tonic ' ) . One other important thing to note , is why changing the root note differs the scale , and that 's because of intervals and is slightly more complicated . Any natural minor scale follows these intervals ( where s is semitone and t is tone ): Root note - > t s t t s t t Whereas major scales follow these intervals : Root note - > t t s t t t s You 'll notice , like with the notes , these follow the same pattern but just start at different places . [ Here 's a handy diagram I drew ] ( URL_3 )<>A key signature is a set of symbols at the beginning of a piece of music that tells you what key the music is written in. The key of a piece of music is the group of notes that the music is mostly centered around.\r\n\r\nThe key of A major and F# minor are the same because they have the same key signature. A key signature has two parts: the sharp symbols and the key name. The key name tells you the main note of the key, and the sharp symbols tell you which notes are sharpened (raised by a half step) in that key.\r\n\r\nIn the key of A major, the main note is A, and the key signature has three sharp symbols: F, C, and G. This means that in the key of A major, the notes F, C, and G are all sharpened. In the key of F# minor, the main note is F#, and the key signature also has three sharp symbols: F, C, and G. This means that in the key of F# minor, the notes F, C, and G are all sharpened too.\r\n\r\nSo, even though the key names are different (A major and F# minor), the key signatures are the same because they both have the same sharp symbols (F, C, and G). This means that the keys of A major and F# minor are related to each other, and the music written in these keys will sound similar to each other.<>reddit_eli5
