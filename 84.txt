Why do environmental scientists ask us to save water when using faucets , showers , etc . wo nt it just go back to the water cycle ? I 'm the type that does n't listen in class . EDIT : Thanks for all the amazing answers ! Please explain like I'm five.
Water we use to bathe , shower , drink , cook with , etc . is all water that has been filtered , processed , and otherwise tinkered with . Yes , it all goes back to the water cycle , but there are costs involved with getting the water to your home in a sanitary state . The less you use , the less water needs to be processed in your area . Particularly in regions with various water problems or droughts it becomes quite an expense to ensure that everyone is getting enough clean water . So they do n't want you running your lawn sprinkler 10 hours a day just because you want perfect looking grass .
Sure! Water is a very important resource that we need to survive. The water cycle is the way that water moves around the Earth. Water evaporates from rivers, lakes, and oceans and becomes water vapor in the air. Then, the water vapor turns into clouds, and the clouds release the water as rain or snow. This water falls back into the rivers, lakes, and oceans and the cycle starts again.The problem is that we are using more water than the Earth can replace. When we use a lot of water, it takes longer for the water to go through the cycle and be available for us to use again. It's like if you have a cup and you keep pouring water out, but you never refill the cup. Eventually, the cup will be empty and you won't have any more water to use. That's why it's important to save water and not use more than we need. We can do this by turning off the faucet when we're not using it, taking shorter showers, and fixing any leaks in our pipes. Does that make sense?
