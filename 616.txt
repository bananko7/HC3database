How much can you write off on a car lease through a LLC?<>An expense is an expense.  You can deduct your lease payment subject to some limitations, but you don't make out by having more expenses.  Higher expenses mean lower profit. Is leasing better than owning?  It depends on the car you'd buy.  If your business doesn't benefit from flashiness of your car, then buying a quality used car (a few years old at most) would probably be a wiser decision financially. I'd think hard about whether you really need an up-to-date car.<>If you use a car for business purposes and you lease it through a limited liability company (LLC), you may be able to write off some or all of the cost of the lease on your business tax return.The amount you can write off will depend on how you use the car and how much you drive it for business purposes. If you use the car exclusively for business, you can typically write off the entire cost of the lease on your tax return. However, if you use the car for both personal and business purposes, you can only write off the portion of the lease that relates to your business use.For example, if you use the car 50% of the time for business and 50% of the time for personal use, you can write off 50% of the cost of the lease on your tax return. If you use the car 75% of the time for business and 25% of the time for personal use, you can write off 75% of the cost of the lease on your tax return.To claim a deduction for the cost of a car lease, you will need to keep good records of your business use of the car, including a log of the miles you drive for business purposes. You will also need to complete IRS Form 4562 and attach it to your tax return.It's important to note that the rules for claiming a deduction for a car lease can be complex, and it's a good idea to consult with a tax professional or refer to IRS guidelines to make sure you are following the proper procedures.<>finance
