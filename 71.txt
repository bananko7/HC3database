Which account type to use for claimable expense I pay upfront for my employer?<>I used Quicken, so this may or may not be helpful. I have a Cash account that I call \"Temporary Assets and Liabilities\" where I track money that I am owed (or that I owe in some cases).  So if I pay for something that is really not my expense, it is transferred to this account (\"transferred\" in Quicken terms).  The payment is then not treated as an expense and the reimbursement is not treated as income--the two transactions just balance out.<>If you are paying for an expense upfront that will be reimbursed to you by your employer, you should record the payment as a business expense in your accounting records. This can be done by using an expense account, which is a type of general ledger account that is used to track the costs incurred by a business.To properly record the transaction, you would need to do the following:Debit the expense account for the amount of the payment.Credit the appropriate asset account, such as cash or accounts payable, for the same amount.When you receive the reimbursement from your employer, you would reverse the transaction by debiting the asset account and crediting the expense account.It's important to keep accurate and detailed records of all business expenses, including those that are paid upfront and reimbursed later, to help ensure that you have a clear and accurate picture of your company's financial position.<>If you are paying for an expense upfront that will be reimbursed to you by your employer, you should record the payment as a business expense in your accounting records.
