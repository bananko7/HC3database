How exactly does the brace position on aircraft help to avoid injury \/ death during impact ? Are we actually any safer ? What does it help to avoid ? Explain like I'm five.<>taken from this website : URL_0 Although the ShockWatch stickers on Buster 's body showed that he would 've made it out alive in either position , his body absorbed more of the impact while sitting upright than in the brace position . Sitting in the brace position channels the crash force from your body to the chair in front of you . That explains why the Federal Aviation Agency claims it 's statistically three times safer to brace for an airplane wreck than to remain upright .<>The brace position is a way of sitting or crouching in an airplane seat that is designed to help protect you during a crash or other emergency landing. When you are in the brace position, you put your head down and your hands on the back of your head, or on the headrest in front of you. This helps to protect your head and neck from injury, because it prevents your head from moving around too much.\r\n\r\nThe brace position also helps to keep your body in a more stable position, which can help to reduce the risk of injury. For example, if you are sitting upright in your seat and the plane crashes, you might be thrown out of your seat or hit by loose objects. But if you are in the brace position, your body is more likely to stay in place and be better able to withstand the forces of the impact.\r\n\r\nSo, while the brace position is not a guarantee of safety, it can help to reduce the risk of injury or death during an emergency landing. It is important to listen to the flight crew and follow their instructions if they tell you to assume the brace position.<>reddit_eli5
