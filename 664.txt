Please explain what is \"Field-effect transistor\"<>The field-effect transistor (FET) is a type of transistor that uses an electric field to control the flow of current in a semiconductor.  FETs (JFETs or MOSFETs) are devices with three terminals: source, gate, and drain. FETs control the flow of current by the application of a voltage to the gate, which in turn alters the conductivity between the drain and source.\nFETs are also known as unipolar transistors since they involve single-carrier-type operation. That is, FETs use either electrons (n-channel) or holes (p-channel) as charge carriers in their operation, but not both. Many different types of field effect transistors exist. Field effect transistors generally display very high input impedance at low frequencies. The most widely used field-effect transistor is the MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor).<>A field-effect transistor (FET) is a type of transistor that uses an electric field to control the flow of current through a channel of semiconductor material. It is a three-terminal device, with a source, drain, and gate. The gate terminal is used to control the flow of current between the source and drain by applying a voltage to the gate.\n\n\n\nFETs are divided into two main types: enhancement-mode and depletion-mode. In an enhancement-mode FET, the channel is \"turned off\" when the gate voltage is zero and is \"turned on\" when a positive voltage is applied to the gate. In a depletion-mode FET, the channel is \"turned on\" when the gate voltage is zero and is \"turned off\" when a negative voltage is applied to the gate.\n\n\n\nFETs are widely used in electronic circuits because they have very low power consumption, high input impedance, and can operate at high speeds. They are used in a variety of applications, including amplifiers, switches, and voltage regulators.<>wiki_csai
