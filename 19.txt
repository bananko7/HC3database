And since it tastes like soda , people drink it like soda . Basically the average energy drink has as much caffeine as a cup of coffee . so when you drink many a day every day it wreaks havoc on your heart .<>Energy drinks and soda are similar in that they both contain added sugars, which can contribute to tooth decay and weight gain when consumed in excess. However, there are a few key differences between the two:\\n\\nCaffeine content: Energy drinks generally contain more caffeine than soda. Caffeine is a stimulant that can make you feel more alert, but it can also cause side effects like increased heart rate and blood pressure, difficulty sleeping, and nervousness. Consuming too much caffeine can be harmful, especially for children and teens.\\n\\nOther ingredients: Energy drinks often contain additional ingredients like herbal supplements, amino acids, and B vitamins, which can have their own potential risks and side effects. Some of these ingredients have not been extensively studied, so it's not always clear what their long-term effects may be.\\n\\nServing sizes: Energy drinks are often sold in larger serving sizes than soda, which means you may be consuming more caffeine and other ingredients in one sitting.\\n\\nOverall, it's important to be mindful of your intake of both energy drinks and soda, as well as other sources of added sugars in your diet. It's generally recommended to limit your intake of added sugars and choose beverages that are lower in sugar or sugar-free whenever possible.<>reddit_eli5
