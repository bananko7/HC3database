How far into space can we go before video or voice transmission would cease ? Even if the home base would not be on earth , what is the distance , if there is any , that would stop communication . Explain like I'm five. <>No distance would be too far . The only limit is the lifespan of the people trying to talk to each other . All forms of light travel at the speed of light . This includes radio waves , which is how you might communicate . If you broadcast such a signal , it will travel out into space forever and ever . However , if you 're trying to talk to someone who is 1 lightyear away , it will take one year for the message to arrive . And a further year for their message to make it back to you . Move the speakers further apart , and it takes even longer . Imagine asking a question , and then telling your descendants to wait around for the answer .<>The distance at which video or voice transmission would cease depends on the technology being used to transmit the signals. In general, the farther a signal has to travel, the weaker it becomes, and at some point it may become too weak to be received or understood.\\n\\nOne factor that can affect the distance at which a signal can be transmitted is the type of signal being used. For example, radio waves can travel much farther than visible light, which is why radio telescopes are used to study objects in deep space.\\n\\nAnother factor that can affect the distance at which a signal can be transmitted is the presence of obstacles or interference. For example, if a signal has to travel through a thick layer of atmosphere or through a dense forest, it may become weaker or distorted.\\n\\nSo, to answer your question, there is no set distance at which video or voice transmission would cease. It all depends on the technology being used and the conditions under which the signal has to travel.<>reddit_eli5
