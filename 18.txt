Many things in life can make you feel strong emotions . Your brain has been meticulously forged by evolution to emote to different events in order to keep you alive . Also , you have been exposed to music throughout your life , and like a dog who learned to salivate when a bell is ringed before the serving of a delicious beef , you learned to emote to different musical patterns differently , which is why this beautiful classical piece makes you feel moved . The building blocks of those emotional responses to different sounds are , however , embedded in all humans from birth . For instance , very low - pitched strong bass sounds make everyone feel edgy , curious and contemplative ( in general ) , which makes it appropriate to space exploration movies ( which also elicit those feelings ) , [ see this for an example . ] ( URL_0 ) The causes for this are related with evolution . Strong low - pitched bass sounds in the wild are generally associated with big predators , and feeling edgy and uneasy when exposed to those sounds probably helped early humans to survive and pass those genes on to you . High pitched , melodic and soft sounds are related to feminine maternal voices , which are associated with feelings of pleasure and safety . Screaming and horror sounds make you feel anxious and worried because those sounds in the wild , again , meant trouble . Source : [ Musician . ] ( URL_1 )
Music has the ability to evoke emotions in listeners because it is a form of art that engages the brain in multiple ways. When we listen to music, our brains process the sounds and rhythms, and we may also have memories or associations connected to the song. Our brains also respond to the patterns and structures in music, which can create feelings of pleasure and arousal. Additionally, the lyrics of a song can also contribute to our emotional response to the music. \nFor example, if you listen to a sad song, you might feel a sense of sadness or melancholy because the music and lyrics are expressing those emotions. Similarly, if you listen to an upbeat and energetic song, you might feel more joyful or energetic. Even if you don't understand the lyrics of a song, the melodies and rhythms can still have an emotional impact on you. \nSo, in short, music is emotionally moving because it engages the brain in multiple ways and can evoke memories and emotions through the sounds, rhythms, patterns, and lyrics of the song.
