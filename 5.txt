Sugar alcohol I just tried a new protein bar and instead of sugar it contained sugar alcohol . What 'd the difference ? Should it be avoided ? Please explain like I'm five.<>It depends on the alcohol . If it 's Maltitol \/ Lycasin , that 's the stuff that 's in those Sugar Free Gummy Bears that turn your butt into a lava machine . It does n't digest well . Sugar Alcohols are what you get in Sugarless Gum , so many of them are n't going to have that effect on you .<>Sugar alcohols are a type of sweetener that is used as a substitute for regular sugar in some food and drinks. They are called \"alcohols\" because they have a chemical structure that is similar to alcohol, but they do not contain any ethanol (the type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages).Sugar alcohols are found naturally in some fruits and vegetables, but they can also be produced in a laboratory. They are often used in sugar-free or reduced-sugar products because they are not completely absorbed by the body and do not cause a spike in blood sugar levels like regular sugar does.There are several different types of sugar alcohols, including xylitol, erythritol, lactitol, and isomalt. Some people may experience digestive symptoms after consuming large amounts of sugar alcohols, such as gas, bloating, and diarrhea. However, these symptoms are not experienced by everyone and can usually be avoided by consuming sugar alcohols in moderation.In general, it is not necessary to avoid sugar alcohols, but it is important to pay attention to the total amount of carbohydrates you consume, including those from sugar alcohols. It is also a good idea to check the nutrition label on food and drink products that contain sugar alcohols to ensure that you are aware of the total carbohydrate content.<>reddit_eli5
