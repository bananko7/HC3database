Why 70 degrees Fahrenheit inside is way too cold , yet 70 degrees outside is the perfect temperature ? This is inspired by a post I saw in \/funny and someone said something about radiant heat by the sun , so explain that too if you can :D Explain like I'm five.
sun shining on you makes you feel warm and comfortable . In the house , you do not have this source of supplemental heat .
It's normal for people to prefer different temperatures inside and outside. Some people might like it cooler inside while others might prefer it warmer. It's also normal for the temperature to feel different inside than it does outside because of the way heat is transferred. Heat can be transferred in three ways: conduction, convection, and radiation. Conduction is the transfer of heat through direct contact, like when you touch a hot stove and your hand gets hot. Convection is the transfer of heat through the movement of fluids, like when hot air rises and cool air sinks. Radiation is the transfer of heat through electromagnetic waves, like when the sun warms your skin. When it's 70 degrees Fahrenheit outside, the heat from the sun is being transferred to your skin through radiation. You might feel comfortable at this temperature because the heat from the sun is warming your body. However, when you are inside, you are not being directly warmed by the sun's heat. Instead, the heat inside your home is being transferred through conduction and convection. This can make the temperature feel colder inside, even if it's the same as it is outside. Some people might prefer to have the temperature inside their home set to a lower temperature because they find it more comfortable, while others might prefer a warmer temperature. It's all a matter of personal preference.
