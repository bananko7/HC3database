Why have n't they invented mechanized legs to replace wheelchairs yet ? Mechanized legs as in some sort of prosthetic that attaches to the leg and is controlled by the owner to walk , and it would replace wheelchairs for the paraplegic . Explain like I'm five.<>They have ! The problem is , they 're 150,000 dollars and do n't perfectly replace a normal gait . Plus , they are n't waterproof or built for all terrains .<>Mechanized legs, also known as exoskeletons or bionic legs, are a type of technology that can help people with paraplegia (paralysis of the legs) walk again. However, they are still being developed and are not yet widely available. There are several reasons for this:\r\n\r\nBuilding a device that can safely and effectively support a person's weight and allow them to walk is very challenging. The device must be strong enough to hold the person up, but also be lightweight and comfortable to wear.\r\n\r\nThe device must also be able to respond to the wearer's movements and intentions, and be able to help them walk smoothly and naturally. This requires sophisticated sensors, computers, and algorithms that can interpret the wearer's body signals and adjust the device's movements accordingly.\r\n\r\nFinally, the device must be affordable and easy to use. This is especially important for people with disabilities, who may have limited financial resources and may need the device to be as simple and straightforward as possible.\r\n\r\nOverall, while mechanized legs have the potential to be a powerful and transformative technology for people with paraplegia, there is still a lot of work to be done to make them a reality.<>reddit_eli5
