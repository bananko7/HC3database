- What 's the difference between a porter and a stout ? They seem to be the same beer ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Porters and stouts are both ales , which means the yeast used to ferment the sugars in the barley tea ( called wort ) ferments at just below room temperature ( lager yeasts ferment at about 20 - 30 F cooler than that ) . The barley used to make beer is roasted , and like coffee there are different levels of roasts you can get . The scale most brewers use is called degrees lovibond . The lighter roasts have more sugar and produce more alcohol , but not much caramelization and flavor . The darker roasts provide the flavor , and usually ales are a blend of varying roasts of malt . The difference between a porter and a stout is simply the proportion of darker - roasted malts used . Stouts use a lot , porters use slightly less .<>Porter and stout are both types of beer that are known for their dark color and rich, full flavor. However, there are some differences between the two. Porter is a type of dark beer that originated in London in the 18th century. It is made with roasted malt, which gives it a dark color and a rich, chocolatey flavor. Porters are usually smooth and easy to drink, with a moderate level of bitterness. Stout is also a type of dark beer, but it is generally stronger and more full-bodied than porter. It is made with a larger proportion of roasted malt and hops, which gives it a bolder, more intense flavor. Stouts often have a more pronounced bitterness and a higher alcohol content than porters. So, to sum it up: porter and stout are both types of dark beer, but stout is usually stronger and has a more intense flavor than porter.<>reddit_eli5
