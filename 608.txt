Why is cooking on a gas stove so much better than electric ? I 've pretty much only cooked on gas stoves so I do n't have much comparison . Why do so many people prefer gas stoves ? Edit : I watch too much HGTV Please explain like I'm five.<>It 's easier to control the heat . If I go from high heat to low heat on a gas range , the change happens instantly . If I go from high heat to low heat on an electric range , I have to wait at least a few seconds for the heat to actually change enough to slow down the cooking process . The reverse is also true -- hot takes longer to get on an electric range . Gas is instant .<>There are a few reasons why some people might prefer cooking with a gas stove: 1. Heat control: It is generally easier to adjust the heat on a gas stove compared to an electric stove. With an electric stove, the heating element takes a while to cool down, so it's hard to quickly reduce the heat. 2. Response time: A gas stove heats up much faster than an electric stove. This can be helpful when you're in a hurry to cook something and need to get the stove up to a high heat quickly. 3. Taste: Some people believe that food cooked on a gas stove tastes better because the heat is more evenly distributed. 4. Cost: Gas stoves can be less expensive to operate than electric stoves, depending on the cost of gas in your area. Overall, it really comes down to personal preference. Some people prefer the control and response time of a gas stove, while others prefer the convenience and even heating of an electric stove.<>reddit_eli5
