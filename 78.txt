Why do we say umm , uhhh or errr ? Why do we say these words or sounds when we are thinking or confused . Why not something else ? How did they come about ? Explain like I'm five.<>It is to give yourself time to think . Every language has their own umm , uhhh , or errr . Spanish & Russian : eh Korean : eum French : euhm German : hm Swedish : va I think it works as a kind of signal to other people , kind of like telling them that you 're pausing speech but still have something else to say .<>\"Umm,\" \"uhhh,\" and \"errr\" are all sounds that people make when they are thinking or unsure of what to say. These sounds are called \"fillers\" because they fill in the space while a person is trying to think of the right word or phrase.\r\n\r\nFillers like \"umm\" and \"uhhh\" are made with the mouth and are called vocalized fillers. People use these sounds when they are trying to buy time to think or when they are unsure of what to say.\r\n\r\n\"Errr\" is a different type of filler. It is made with the tongue and is called a non-vocalized filler. People use this sound when they are unsure of what to do or say, or when they are trying to decide between two different options.\r\n\r\nIt is not exactly clear how these fillers came about, but they are common in many different languages and cultures around the world. They are a natural part of how people communicate and can be used to show that a person is thinking or to signal that they are not sure of the right thing to say.<>\"Umm,\" \"uhhh,\" and \"errr\" are all sounds that people make when they are thinking or unsure of what to say.
