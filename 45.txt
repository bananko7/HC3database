Scientific Creationism I would like this explained to me by a Christian not an atheist . Explain like I'm five.<>Scientific creationism is an attempt to reconcile the literal genesis account in the bible with scientific observations . They will typically agree on the observations but disagree on interpretation . For example , a regular scientist would say that the reason fossils appear at different layers is that one fossil died and was buried and over millions of years , more layers formed and then a different animal died and was buried at a higher level . I creationist would say that they were all buried at the same time in sediment during Noah 's flood .<>Scientific creationism is a belief held by some people who are Christian. It is the idea that God created the universe and everything in it, including living things like people and animals. Some people who believe in scientific creationism think that the story of God creating the world in the book of Genesis in the Bible is literally true and can be supported by scientific evidence. Other people who believe in scientific creationism think that the story of God creating the world in the Bible is a metaphor or a way of explaining things that can't be fully understood. Do you have any questions about scientific creationism that I can help with?<>reddit_eli5
