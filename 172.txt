How do astronauts withstand the noise of launch , while spectators need to be miles away says here the eardrum is instantly perforated at 160 dB URL_0 while a saturn rocket neared 200 dB where can I get shuttle - launch - grade earmuffs ? Explain like I'm five.<>They were in the pod designed to handle the stresses of launch , and were wearing special suits .<>Astronauts are protected from the loud noise of a rocket launch in a few different ways. First, they wear special earplugs or earmuffs that help to block out some of the noise. These earplugs or earmuffs are made of materials that are designed to absorb sound waves and reduce the amount of noise that reaches the eardrums. Second, the inside of the spacecraft is designed to be very sturdy and able to withstand the vibrations and noise of the launch. The walls of the spacecraft are thick and made of materials that are able to absorb some of the sound waves and reduce the amount of noise that reaches the astronauts. Finally, the astronauts are also seated in a special area of the spacecraft that is designed to be as quiet as possible. This helps to reduce the amount of noise that they are exposed to during the launch. Overall, these measures help to protect the astronauts' ears and prevent their eardrums from being damaged by the loud noise of the rocket launch. It is still very loud inside the spacecraft during the launch, but the astronauts are able to withstand it thanks to these protective measures. As for where you can get shuttle-launch-grade earmuffs, it is possible that they may be available for purchase from some specialty stores or online retailers. However, it is important to note that these earmuffs are designed for use by trained professionals, such as astronauts, and may not be suitable for use by the general public.<>reddit_eli5
