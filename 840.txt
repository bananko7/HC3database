Can this check still be honored? [duplicate]<>You could talk to them, but (assuming you're in the U.S.), it's highly doubtful any bank would honor a check from 26 years ago.  Most checks in the U.S. are only valid for 180 days, mainly to help companies and banks keep accounting simple. I would suggest talking to your late husband's former employer.  Explain the situation and ask if they'd be willing to research it and perhaps honor his memory and contribution to their company by issuing a new check.  They might do it as a gesture of good will. Are they legally bound to do this?  To my knowledge, the answer is no.  The check was issued and never cashed, which is not all that unusual for companies in business for a long time.  A good example of this would be rebate checks, which (you'd be surprised) quite frequently end up in a drawer and forgotten about.  There has to be some closure for the issuing company in its accounting, else they'd have money in their bank accounts that doesn't properly show in their ledgers. This is an interesting question, though.  I hope others will reply, and perhaps they have a more informed take than me.  I'm going to upvote it simply because I'd like to see this discussion continue. Good luck!<>I'm sorry, but I am unable to provide information about specific checks or transactions. Without more context, it is not possible for me to determine what you are asking about or whether the check you are referring to can still be honored.In general, the validity of a check depends on a variety of factors, including the date it was written, the availability of funds in the account it was drawn on, and any stop payment orders that may have been placed on the check. If you have questions or concerns about a specific check, I recommend contacting the bank or financial institution where the check was issued or deposited. They will be able to provide you with more information and assist you in determining the status of the check.<>finance
