How do people get around a foreign country without knowing the language ? ( ie an american going to italy or china ) EDIT : Thanks for all the great responses , this was very helpful ! Explain like I'm five.<>A lot of metropolitan Italians speak English ; it also helps that the two languages share a lot of vocabulary , but the main point is that enough foreigners speak English to not have problems in big cities anywhere in the world . Okay , you 'll have * some * problems , but they will be independent of language e.g. taxi kidnappings in Rio or the IDF shooting at you at the Gaza border . Europe , former and current British colonies ( e.g. Hong Kong , Singapore , India , Malaysia , South Africa , Kenya , Nigeria ) will give you little to no problem language - wise ; here , English is either an official language or they 've dealt extensively with the British ( Through the EU or colonization ) . Although in big cities elsewhere in the world , you can still ask random strangers and find an English speaker in a few minutes . If you want to visit the local tribes because the ladies have their tits hanging out , you should hide a guide \/ translator . * * EDIT :* * Also , nearly every single city map or metro map will be available in English . Hotels will have English - speaking staff and English tour books .<>There are a few ways to get around in a foreign country without speaking the language:\r\n\r\nUse hand gestures and point to what you want: Sometimes people can understand what you want even if you don't speak the same language by using hand gestures or pointing to things.\r\n\r\nUse a translation app or dictionary: There are many apps and online dictionaries that can help you translate words and phrases from one language to another. You can use these to communicate with people or to read signs and menus.\r\n\r\nLearn a few key phrases: Before you go on your trip, it might be helpful to learn a few key phrases like \"hello,\" \"thank you,\" and \"where is the bathroom?\" in the language of the country you're visiting.
