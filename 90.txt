What happens if you managed to trap light inside a cube of mirrors ? Do you get infinite light ? Please explain like I'm five.
Assuming 100 % perfect mirrors , yes . Those however do n't exist - no mirror can reflect 100 % of the light that hits it . So while the light would bounce around for awhile , it would rapidly fade out ( quicker than any human can detect for sure ) .
If you managed to trap light inside a cube of mirrors, you would get an effect called \"infinite regress,\" where the light bounces back and forth between the mirrors indefinitely. This means that the light would not be able to escape from the cube, and it would continue to bounce around inside forever. Imagine a ball bouncing around inside a room with four walls. If you throw the ball at one wall, it will bounce off and hit another wall. It will keep bouncing back and forth between the walls until it eventually comes to a stop. Now imagine that the walls of the room are made of mirrors. If you throw the ball at a mirror, it will bounce off and hit another mirror, just like before. But because the mirrors are so shiny, the ball will also bounce back toward the first mirror it hit. This means that it will keep bouncing back and forth between the two mirrors indefinitely. Now, instead of a ball, imagine that the light is bouncing around inside the cube of mirrors. Just like the ball, the light will bounce back and forth between the mirrors until it eventually comes to a stop. However, because the mirrors are so shiny, the light will keep bouncing back and forth between them indefinitely, creating the effect of \"infinite light.\"
