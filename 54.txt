What exactly is the issue with bees right now , why are people concerned about them ? The bug \/ insect , just for clarification . Please explain like I'm five.<>Bees are * very * important in the process of pollinating plants and crops . They do it on a constant basis , as a process of living . It 's the easiest form of \" free labor \" you can have . There 's been a big issue in recent years where bees have been dropping rapidly in number , which can cause a huge dent in the farming industry and in nature itself .<>Bees are really important for our environment because they help pollinate flowers and plants. Pollination is when bees transfer the pollen from one plant to another, and this helps the plants grow and produce food, like fruit and vegetables. Some people are worried about bees because there are fewer of them than there used to be. This is called \"bee decline\" or \"colony collapse disorder,\" and it can be caused by things like pests and diseases, changes in the environment, and the use of certain pesticides. When there are fewer bees, it can be harder for plants to grow and produce food, which can be a problem for people and animals that rely on those plants for food.<>reddit_eli5
