Please explain what is \"Intelligent agent\"<>In artificial intelligence, an intelligent agent (IA) is anything which perceives its environment, takes actions autonomously in order to achieve goals, and may improve its performance with learning or may use knowledge. They may be simple or complex â€” a thermostat is considered an example of an intelligent agent, as is a human being, as is any system that meets the definition, such as a firm, a state, or a biome.\nLeading AI textbooks define \"artificial intelligence\" as the \"study and design of intelligent agents\", a definition that considers goal-directed behavior to be the essence of intelligence. Goal-directed agents are also described using a term borrowed from economics, \"rational agent\".\nAn agent has an \"objective function\" that encapsulates all the IA's goals. Such an agent is designed to create and execute whatever plan will, upon completion, maximize the expected value of the objective function. For example, a reinforcement learning agent has a \"reward function\" that allows the programmers to shape the IA's desired behavior, and an evolutionary algorithm's behavior is shaped by a \"fitness function\".\nIntelligent agents in artificial intelligence are closely related to agents in economics, and versions of the intelligent agent paradigm are studied in cognitive science, ethics, the philosophy of practical reason, as well as in many interdisciplinary socio-cognitive modeling and computer social simulations. \nIntelligent agents are often described schematically as an abstract functional system similar to a computer program. Abstract descriptions of intelligent agents are called abstract intelligent agents (AIA) to distinguish them from their real-world implementations. An autonomous intelligent agent is designed to function in the absence of human intervention. Intelligent agents are also closely related to software agents (an autonomous computer program that carries out tasks on behalf of users).<>An intelligent agent is a software program that is designed to perform tasks or solve problems in a way that simulates the thought processes of a human. Intelligent agents are often used in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning applications to perform tasks that require some degree of decision-making or problem-solving.\n\n\n\nIntelligent agents are designed to be proactive and autonomous, meaning they are able to take actions on their own without explicit instructions. They are also able to learn and adapt to new situations over time. For example, an intelligent agent might be used to monitor a system and take corrective action if it detects a problem, or to learn from data and make decisions based on that data.\n\n\n\nIntelligent agents are often used in a variety of applications, including natural language processing, expert systems, robotics, and automated decision-making. They can be integrated into a wide range of systems and environments, including web browsers, mobile devices, and home automation systems.<>wiki_csai
