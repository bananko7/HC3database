What are some valuable sources for investment experience, when there is very little to no money to start with?<>One way to start with stocks is by playing the fake stock market.  Investigate what trading fees would be with a broker, then \"invest\" a certain amount of money - note it on paper or in a spreadsheet.  Follow your stocks, make decisions on selling and buying, and see where you would be after a year or so.  That way you can get an idea, even if not exactly precise, on what your returns would be if you really invested the money.<>There are a few options for gaining investment experience when you have very little money to start with:Virtual trading platforms: Many online brokerage firms offer virtual trading platforms that allow you to practice trading with virtual money.
