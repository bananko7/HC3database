Why do n't obese people get ripped from all the extra weight they 're carrying ? Would n't carrying 300 + pounds of weight , all day , every day , build some muscle ? Please explain like I'm five.<>They DO build muscle , but they are n't building muscle all over , they are n't building it evenly , and they are n't building \" show \" muscles . Obese people will often develop stronger legs to carry their weight and some strength in their back and shoulders too . They 're not necessarily going to get arm , chest , or core strength however . All over \/r \/ fitness you 'll see posts now and again about obese people dropping hundreds of pounds by dieting , and they often have VERY strong legs , MUCH stronger than their arms . That said , there is also the issue of sedentary lifestyle choices , as mentioned by Kitworks .<>Carrying around extra weight can certainly contribute to the development of some muscle, but it is not a guarantee. The amount of muscle that a person can build is influenced by several factors, including genetics, diet, and exercise. When a person is obese, they are carrying around a lot of extra fat in addition to muscle. The extra fat can make it more difficult for the person to move around and perform physical activities, which can limit their ability to build muscle. Additionally, the person's diet and exercise habits may not be conducive to muscle building. To build muscle, a person needs to engage in activities that challenge their muscles and stimulate growth, such as lifting weights or doing bodyweight exercises. They also need to eat a diet that provides enough protein and other nutrients to support muscle growth. So, while it is possible for an obese person to build muscle, it is not a given. It requires effort and consistency in both exercise and nutrition.<>reddit_eli5
