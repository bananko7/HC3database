Why are snails so slow ? What 's the natural reason why snails are so slow , considering that speed is usually much better for survival Explain like I'm five.<>\" speed is better for survival \" . No . Just look at plants . They ca n't move at all and there are way more than animals<>\\nSnails are slow for several reasons. First, snails are small creatures, and it takes less energy for them to move slowly than it does for larger animals to move quickly. Second, snails have a slimy, moist layer on their underside called a foot, which helps them move smoothly over rough surfaces. This slimy foot also helps them stick to surfaces, which is useful for climbing and avoiding predators. Finally, snails are herbivores, which means they eat plants rather than other animals. They don't need to move quickly to catch their food, and they can find plenty of food by moving slowly and methodically. All of these factors contribute to the snail's slow pace of life.<>reddit_eli5
