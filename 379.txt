Would n't Pi eventually have a pattern because its infinite ? On the other hand , you also can not prove it does or does not have a pattern . Then why do teachers say it does n't ? Please explain like I'm five.<>> On the other hand , you also can not prove it does or does not have a pattern . You can , and people have ! It 's been [ proven that pi is irrational ] ( URL_0 ) , which means that it does n't repeat . The actual proofs are a little beyond ELI5 , but there are multiple ones . Being infinite does n't imply that there will eventually be a pattern .<>Pi (Ï€) is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. It is a mathematical constant that is approximately equal to 3.14159. Pi is an irrational number, which means that it cannot be expressed as a simple fraction and has an infinite number of decimal places. The decimal representation of Pi goes on indefinitely and does not repeat in a regular pattern. It is not possible to prove that Pi does or does not have a pattern because it is an infinite decimal. However, based on the mathematical definitions of Pi and the way it is calculated, it is generally accepted that the decimal representation of Pi does not have a repeating pattern. Teachers may say that Pi does not have a pattern because this is the accepted understanding of Pi in mathematics. However, it is important to note that this is just a mathematical concept and it is not possible to prove it with absolute certainty.<>reddit_eli5
