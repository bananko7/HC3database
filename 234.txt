Why does it take Amazon several days to \" prepare \" items for shipment ? Are n't they in a warehouse somewhere ready to go ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Okay , you know how a mailman comes to your house every day , it 's kinda like that for amazon , except instead of your house , it is a warehouse with thousands and thousands of items shipped every day . If you order it later in the day , you 've likely missed the delivery company 's pickup , so you have to wait till the next one . Another thing that might be a cause for amazon taking more than one day is that they can only physically ship or set up postage for so many items per day , so if there are lots of people ordering one day , it may take another day or two to process the shipments .<>There are a few reasons why it might take Amazon a few days to prepare an item for shipment.First, Amazon has a very large inventory of products, and they may not have all of the items they sell in a single warehouse. Instead, they might have different warehouses for different types of products, or they might have warehouses in different parts of the country or world. This means that it might take a little bit of time to locate the item you want and get it ready to ship.Second, even if the item is in a warehouse and is ready to go, Amazon still has to process your order and make sure it's ready for shipment. This includes things like packing the item, labeling it with the correct shipping information, and making sure it's ready to be shipped out. This process can take a little bit of time, especially if Amazon is getting a lot of orders.Finally, it's also possible that the item you ordered is currently out of stock and needs to be restocked before it can be shipped. This can also take a few days, as Amazon needs to wait for more of the item to be produced or shipped to them.Overall, there are many different factors that can contribute to why it takes Amazon a few days to prepare an item for shipment, but the main reason is usually just that they have a lot of orders to process and they want to make sure everything is done correctly before the item is shipped out.<>reddit_eli5
