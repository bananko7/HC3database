How do large cities not run out of number and letters combinations to put on license plates ? What would happen if they did ? Title . Explain like I'm five. <>Because with a 7 digit license plate , there are over 78 billion unique combinations of letters and numbers . If any licensing agency somehow managed to exhaust that number , they would just add another digit .<>In large cities, there are usually so many different cars that it's unlikely that they would run out of combinations of letters and numbers to use for license plates. If a city did run out of combinations, they could simply create more combinations by using more letters or adding more numbers to the plates. For example, they might use a combination of three letters and three numbers instead of just two of each.\\n\\nIt's also possible for a city to recycle old license plate combinations that are no longer in use. For example, if someone gets a new car and gets a new license plate, the old plate and its combination of letters and numbers would be available to be used again.\\n\\nOverall, it's not likely that a city would run out of combinations for license plates, but if it did happen, there are ways to create more combinations or recycle old ones to solve the problem.<>reddit_eli5
