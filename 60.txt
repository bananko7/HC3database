Why are objects of different mass pulled to the Earth at the same speed ? If all mass has gravity , and denser mass has a stronger gravitational pull , should n't denser objects pull themselves to Earth stronger than lighter objects , thus \" falling \" faster ? Explain like I'm five.
Inertia . Larger objects do experience a larger pull , but because they have a larger inertia they need this larger pull to make them accelerate . F = ma . If you have more mass , you need a larger force to achieve the same acceleration . [ Veritasium- Misconceptions about falling objects ] ( URL_0 )
Gravity causes everything to be pulled towards the ground, but the amount of gravity an object has depends on its mass. A denser object, like a rock, will have more gravity than a less dense object, like a balloon filled with air. Even though the rock has more gravity, it still falls at the same speed as the balloon because the air around the balloon pushes back against the balloon and slows it down. This is called air resistance. So, even though the rock is denser and has more gravity, it still falls at the same speed as the balloon because the air is pushing back against the balloon and slowing it down.
