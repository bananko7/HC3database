Why does electricity hum ? Generally , what causes power lines to hum ? Especially when a tree limb or something hits a transformer and it hums loudly before it explodes ? Explain like I'm five.<>Because it does n't know the words ! HAHAHAHAHAHA !<>Electricity humming is caused by the movement of the electric current through the power lines. When the electricity flows through the power lines, it creates a vibrating motion that can produce a humming sound. The sound is usually caused by the movement of the electrons within the wire.\n\nSometimes, when a tree limb or other object hits a transformer, it can cause a short circuit, which can cause the transformer to produce a loud humming sound. This can happen because the transformer is designed to step up or step down the voltage of the electricity, and when it is damaged, it may not be able to do this properly. The humming sound is often an indication that the transformer is not working properly and may be damaged.\n\nIf you hear a loud humming sound coming from a transformer or power line, it is important to stay away from it and contact your local electric company for help. A damaged transformer or power line can be dangerous and could potentially cause an electrical fire.<>reddit_eli5
