Why do electonics that display the time ( ie microwaves ) not have a small battery to ensure the time to saved in the event a power outage ? My clock \/ radio has a battery and it costs approx 10â€° of the microwave . Please explain like I'm five.<>A battery costs money . The circuit to integrate the battery costs money . Designing the circuit to integrate the battery costs money . Assembling the circuit to integrate the battery costs money . No customer at the store chooses which model of microwave to buy based on if it has a battery or not . It is not a selling point . So , adding a battery would cost extra money while not adding to the price the unit could be sold for . Appliances are about the bottom line .<>Electronic devices like microwaves and clocks often have a small battery backup to ensure that the time is saved in the event of a power outage. This is typically a small coin-sized battery, like a CR2032, that provides just enough power to keep the device running and maintain the time and other settings. The reason that these devices don't use a larger battery, like the one in your clock radio, is because they don't need to run for long periods of time without power. In the case of a power outage, the device will likely be turned off or unplugged, so it doesn't need to have a lot of stored power. A small battery is sufficient to keep the time and other settings for a short period of time, until the power is restored or the device is plugged in again. It's also important to consider the cost and size of the battery. A larger battery would take up more space and add to the cost of the device, which is something that manufacturers try to avoid. By using a smaller battery, they can keep the size and cost of the device down while still providing the necessary backup power.<>reddit_eli5
