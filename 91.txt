Why are there far more bald men than bald women ? Is there something about hair - loss that targets Male genes over Female ones ? Explain like I'm five.
Male pattern baldness is caused by DHT in the scalp ( a potent form of Testosterone ) so the higher your Testosterone levels the more quickly you bald . ( there are also some genetic factors also but this is the reason for the sex disparity )
Baldness is more common in men than in women because of genetics. Men and women both have the same types of hair on their heads, but men's hair is more sensitive to a hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT). When men have high levels of DHT, it can cause their hair to thin and fall out. This is called male pattern baldness.\r\n\r\nWomen also have DHT, but their hair is less sensitive to it, so they are less likely to experience hair loss. However, some women can still experience hair loss due to other factors, such as medical conditions, certain medications, or age.\r\n\r\nOverall, baldness is more common in men because of the way their bodies respond to DHT. It's not that male genes are targeted more than female ones, it's just that men's bodies are more likely to experience hair loss due to the way they respond to DHT.
