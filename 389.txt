it 's obvious radioactive water leaking into the ocean , but what does this mean for the rest of the world ? Will just staying away from Japanese fish be enough ? Wish I knew more . Explain like I'm five.<>The amount of radioactive substance being released into the water is negligible when compared to the amount of water in the oceans . Locally to the power plant it 's an issue , but for most of the rest of the world , it 's not a big deal . Any radioactivity should be very diluted before it gets too far .<>Radiation is a type of energy that is emitted by certain types of matter, such as certain elements or isotopes. When water becomes contaminated with radioactive substances, it can be harmful to people and the environment. If radioactive water is leaking into the ocean, it means that the water in the ocean is becoming contaminated with radioactive substances. This can be a problem because many people rely on the ocean for food, such as fish and other seafood. If the fish and other seafood are contaminated with radiation, they could be harmful to eat. To stay safe, it's a good idea to avoid eating fish and other seafood from the area where the radioactive water is leaking. However, it's important to note that radiation can also travel through the air, so it's possible that the radiation from the leak could affect other areas as well. In general, it's a good idea to be careful about what we eat and where it comes from, and to follow guidelines and recommendations from experts about what is safe to eat.<>reddit_eli5
