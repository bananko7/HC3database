Why do tennis pros need coaches ? What do they do ? Surely the big pros are way better at their sport than their coaches ever were . Thank you :) Makes sense . Explain like I'm five.<>Some people do n't have the capacity to BE the best , but they can analyze the best , and give tips on technique or even just be there to push players and set up training sessions for weaknesses . You ca n't play tennis looking in the mirror to spot your own flaws , so you get a good coach .<>Even though professional tennis players are incredibly skilled at their sport, they can still benefit from the guidance and support of a coach. A coach can help a player develop and improve their skills, devise a strategy for matches, and provide motivation and support. For example, a coach can help a player identify areas of their game that need improvement and come up with a plan to work on those areas. They can also help a player prepare for specific opponents by analyzing their strengths and weaknesses and coming up with a game plan to exploit their opponents' weaknesses and protect against their strengths. Additionally, a coach can provide emotional support and motivation to help a player stay focused and confident. This is especially important during tough matches or when a player is dealing with injuries or other challenges. Overall, a coach can be an important partner for a professional tennis player, helping them to reach their full potential and achieve success on the court.<>reddit_eli5
