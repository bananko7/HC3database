What 's a Catch-22 ? Thanks . I 'd appreciate some examples . Explain like I'm five.<>It 's from a book written about WWII . In the book , the flight surgeon would take the combat pilots off flight status if they were crazy . The thing is , a pilot would have to be crazy to fly combat missions . So I a pilot went to the flight surgeon and said he no longer wanted to fly combat missions , he must be sane . If he did n't ask to be taken off combat missions , he must be crazy , but would still fly the missions until he asked to be taken off . This was called catch 22 . Another example that you may have heard is you ca n't get a job without experience , but you ca n't get experience if you ca n't get a job .<>A Catch-22 is a situation in which a person is trapped by contradictory rules or conditions. The term comes from the novel \"Catch-22\" by Joseph Heller, in which the main character, Yossarian, is an American soldier in World War II.\n\nHere's an example of a Catch-22:\n\nImagine you want to get a driver's license, but you need to have a car to practice driving. However, you can't buy a car until you have a driver's license. This is a Catch-22 because you need a driver's license to buy a car, but you need a car to get a driver's license.\n\nHere's another example:\n\nImagine you are sick and need to go to the doctor, but you can't get an appointment unless you have a referral from another doctor. However, you can't see another doctor unless you have an appointment. This is a Catch-22 because you need to see a doctor to get a referral, but you need a referral to see a doctor.\n\nIn both of these examples, there is no way to solve the problem because the rules or conditions are contradictory. Do you understand?<>reddit_eli5
