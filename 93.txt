Please explain what is \"Receiver operating characteristic\"<>A receiver operating characteristic curve, or ROC curve, is a graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied.  The method was originally developed for operators of military radar receivers starting in 1941, which led to its name.\nThe ROC curve is created by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings. The true-positive rate is also known as sensitivity, recall or probability of detection.[10] The false-positive rate is also known as probability of false alarm[10] and can be calculated as (1 − specificity). The ROC can also be thought of as a plot of the power as a function of the Type I Error of the decision rule (when the performance is calculated from just a sample of the population, it can be thought of as estimators of these quantities). The ROC curve is thus the sensitivity or recall as a function of fall-out. In general, if the probability distributions for both detection and false alarm are known, the ROC curve can be generated by plotting the cumulative distribution function (area under the probability distribution from \n\n\n\n−\n∞\n\n\n{\\displaystyle -\\infty }\n\n to the discrimination threshold) of the detection probability in the y-axis versus the cumulative distribution function of the false-alarm probability on the x-axis.\nROC analysis provides tools to select possibly optimal models and to discard suboptimal ones independently from (and prior to specifying) the cost context or the class distribution. ROC analysis is related in a direct and natural way to cost\/benefit analysis of diagnostic decision making.\nThe ROC curve was first developed by electrical engineers and radar engineers during World War II for detecting enemy objects in battlefields and was soon introduced to psychology to account for perceptual detection of stimuli. ROC analysis since then has been used in medicine, radiology, biometrics, forecasting of natural hazards,[11] meteorology,[12] model performance assessment,[13] and other areas for many decades and is increasingly used in machine learning and data mining research.\nThe ROC is also known as a relative operating characteristic curve, because it is a comparison of two operating characteristics (TPR and FPR) as the criterion changes.[14]<>Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) is a graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied. It is created by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various classification thresholds. The true positive rate is the number of true positive results divided by the total number of positive results, while the false positive rate is the number of false positive results divided by the total number of negative results.\n\n\n\nThe ROC curve is a useful tool for evaluating and comparing the performance of different classifier models. A classifier with an ROC curve that is farther to the top left corner of the plot (toward the point (0,1)) is considered to be a better classifier, because it is able to correctly identify more positive cases while also minimizing the number of false positive cases.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the ROC curve, the area under the curve (AUC) is often used as a metric for evaluating classifier performance. A classifier with an AUC of 1 has perfect discrimination, while a classifier with an AUC of 0.5 has no discrimination ability.\n\n\n\nROC curves and AUC are widely used in a variety of applications, including medical diagnosis, credit scoring, and spam filtering.<>wiki_csai
