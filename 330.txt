How can I calculate interest portion of income when selling a stock?<>Their interest expense was $17M.

I understand your concern, but this company is not \"sitting on cash\" as are Apple, Google, etc. Short term rates are well below 1%, 1yr tbill looks like about .2%.

OP is asking about a specific part of the company cash flow. His worst case is $1 per 100 shares.<>To calculate the interest portion of income from selling a stock, you will need to determine the holding period of the stock and the amount of interest income earned from the sale.Here is the general process for calculating the interest portion of income from selling a stock:Determine the holding period of the stock: The holding period is the length of time that you owned the stock before selling it. If you held the stock for more than one year before selling it, the gain or loss from the sale is considered to be long-term. If you held the stock for one year or less, the gain or loss is considered to be short-term.Calculate the gain or loss from the sale: To calculate the gain or loss, subtract the purchase price of the stock (including any commissions or fees) from the sale price of the stock. If the result is positive, you have a gain. If the result is negative, you have a loss.Determine the tax rate on the gain or loss: The tax rate on the gain or loss from the sale of a stock depends on the holding period and your tax bracket. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than short-term capital gains.Calculate the interest portion of the income: The interest portion of the income is the portion of the gain or loss that is taxed at the tax rate for interest income. If the gain or loss is long-term, the entire amount is taxed at the long-term capital gains tax rate. If the gain or loss is short-term, the entire amount is taxed at the short-term capital gains tax rate, which is the same as the tax rate for ordinary income.For example, let's say that you bought 100 shares of a stock for $50 per share, including commissions, and you sold the stock for $75 per share, including commissions. Your total gain on the sale would be $2,500 ($75 per share x 100 shares - $50 per share x 100 shares). If you held the stock for more than one year, your gain would be taxed at the long-term capital gains tax rate. If you held the stock for one year or less, your gain would be taxed at the short-term capital gains tax rate, which is the same as the tax rate for ordinary income.<>finance
