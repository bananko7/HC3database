How exactly is the meat industry causing so much pollution ? I 'm always reading about how the meat industry is the worst contributor to global warning . What is it about the industry that makes it so damaging to the environment ? Explain like I'm five.<>As with anything it depends . The easiest to point a finger at is the beef cattle industry so I 'll take a whack at that . Three main reasons : farts , inefficiency , and erosion \/ runoff . Cows have a sequenced digestive process and they give off a lot of methane . Methane is a greenhouse gas that is much stronger at causing the greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide which is what most people worry about ( think of car pollution and planting trees for carbon offsets ) The meat industry is inefficient with how animals are fed . In terms of resources used to make a single serving , beef has some of the most resources for the smallest amount . This is particularly true for water . Fresh water resources are a difficult thing to manage and meat industries use an incredible amount of water all the way from watering feed crops \/ pastures to keeping the animals themselves hydrated . Another big issue is erosion and runoff caused by cattle farming . These are mainly a result of how , being an industry , you have areas where there are many hundreds or even thousands of cattle near each other . The sheer physical presence of so many cows causes the landscape to change . Often they will be near a stream or river ( because they need water to drink and irrigate their pastures ) . The change in landscape from so many cows ends up damaging the waterways so much that it is often unable to ever repair itself . Also all the urine from cattle ( not to forget any fertilizer used by the farmer ) causes anything downstream that is n't destroyed to be contaminated . I strayed and talked more about environmental impact and not just pollution but people often use the two terms interchangeably . If you mean just air pollution then it is the first point I made plus diesel transport trucks and the desire of people wanting meat all times of the year making it a continuous process instead of seasonal to give Mother Nature a break . On mobile but studied this kind of thing ;)<>\\nThe meat industry has a big impact on the environment because of the way animals are raised and processed for meat. Here are a few ways that the meat industry contributes to pollution:\\n\\nThe production of feed for animals, such as corn and soy, requires a lot of water, pesticides, and fertilizers, which can pollute rivers and streams.\\n\\nLivestock, such as cows and pigs, produce methane gas as part of their digestion process. Methane is a greenhouse gas that traps heat in the atmosphere and contributes to global warming.\\n\\nAnimal waste from factory farms can contain harmful bacteria and chemicals. If this waste isn't properly managed, it can contaminate water sources and air quality.\\n\\nThe transportation of animals and meat products requires the use of fossil fuels, which emit greenhouse gases and contribute to air pollution.\\n\\nThe processing of meat requires a lot of energy, which often comes from burning fossil fuels, which also contributes to air pollution.\\n\\nOverall, the meat industry has a big impact on the environment because it requires a lot of resources and generates a lot of waste and pollution.\\n<>reddit_eli5
