What is the purpose of terrorist attacks , if they only give the group a bad name ? Unless it 's a hostage situation or something , where the terrorists have something to gain , what purpose do they actually serve ? Explain like I'm five.<>Apparently Osama bin Laden said that the purpose of his campaign was to destabilise the USA by bankrupting it . He claimed similar tactics brought about the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1980s and early 1990s when they got bogged down in an expensive war in Afghanistan . In other arenas , the IRA would claim that their campaign of violence in the 1970s , 1980s and 1990s got them a seat at the negotiating table at the Good Friday peace talks , although they seem to have realised that independence through violent uprising was a lost cause by 1998 . On the ground , the suicide bombers are likely to be motivated by a mixture of desperation , religious extremism , vengeance and brainwashing . You ca n't expect much logic there . A lot of countries have won independence on the back of armed uprisings ( e.g. Cuba , Israel , USA ) . If they are successful , they call themselves liberators . If they are unsuccessful , the winners label them terrorists , so a lot of it is propaganda and semantics .<>Terrorist attacks are often carried out by groups or individuals who want to spread fear and chaos, and who want to make a political or social statement. The goal is often to try to force people or governments to do something, or to change their beliefs or policies. The people who carry out terrorist attacks usually believe that they are fighting for a cause that is more important than the harm that they are causing. However, most people and governments do not agree with the methods or goals of terrorists, and see their actions as violent and wrong.<>reddit_eli5
