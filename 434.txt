Why are we able to commit suicide ? If we are hard wired to procreate and survive , why are people able to go around that and commit suicide ? I have thought about suicide a lot and attempted once , this is something I have always wondered . Explain like I'm five.<>We are n't \" hard wired \" to do anything . Biology , and particular behavior , are n't nearly so simple as that . Human behavior is the product of a vast and overlapping series of feedback loops * plus * all the cognitive stuff that makes us able to think and learn . There 's nothing so straightforward about any of it .<>It's important to remember that human beings are complex creatures, and our thoughts and behaviors are influenced by a variety of factors. While it is true that our brains are hardwired to seek pleasure and avoid pain, and to survive and reproduce, this does not mean that every person will always act in ways that align with these instincts. Sometimes, people may feel overwhelmed by difficult emotions or circumstances, and they may feel like they are unable to cope or find a way to move forward. When a person is in this state, they may turn to suicide as a way to escape the pain they are experiencing. This does not mean that they do not value life or that they do not want to survive, but rather that they feel like they are unable to cope with their current situation and that suicide feels like the only way out. It's important to remember that if you are struggling with thoughts of suicide, you are not alone, and there is help available. It is okay to ask for help and to reach out to someone you trust, whether it's a friend, family member, or a mental health professional. There are also hotlines and other resources available that can provide support and guidance.<>reddit_eli5
