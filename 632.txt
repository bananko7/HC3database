This is because jealousy is a natural emotion that can arise in any social group, including cats.\r\n\r\nWhen a cat sees you giving attention to another cat, they might feel like they are being left out or replaced, which can cause them to feel jealous. Cats are social animals, and they often want to be the center of attention and affection. When they see another cat getting this attention instead of them, they may feel jealous.\r\n\r\nThere isn't a scientific answer that can prove whether or not cats feel jealous, but many cat owners have reported that their cats seem to display jealous behavior when they see them giving attention to other animals. If you have multiple cats at home, you may have noticed that they sometimes compete for your affection or try to get your attention when you are petting another cat. This could be a sign that they are feeling jealous.<>reddit_eli5
