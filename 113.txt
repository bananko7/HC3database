Why do we have a bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , and Firearms ? Why do those three specific things get their own Federal law enforcement agency ? Also , what high crimes are being committed in regards to alcohol and tobacco ? Explain like I'm five. <>It 's the ATFE now . Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives . These 3 things ( now 4 ) were specifically bundled together because they are \" legal \" under US Law but are heavily regulated and are thus more complicated to police . These items , when sold illegally , are usually done so across state lines and thus can not be handled by any State Agency . Hence the need for a Federal Agency .<>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) is a federal law enforcement agency that is responsible for enforcing laws related to the production, sale, and use of alcohol, tobacco, and firearms. These three specific things are regulated by the federal government because they can have an impact on public safety and the health of people who use them. The ATF works to prevent illegal activities related to alcohol, tobacco, and firearms, such as selling alcohol to minors, smuggling tobacco products to avoid paying taxes, and selling guns to people who are not allowed to have them.<>reddit_eli5
