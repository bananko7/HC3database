Mangat.<>It is generally not recommended to take prochlorperazine (also known as Compazine) with immunosuppressant medications that are used to prevent organ rejection after a transplant, as the combination may increase the risk of side effects. Prochlorperazine is a type of anti-nausea medication that belongs to a class of drugs called phenothiazines, which can weaken the immune system and increase the risk of infection.\n\nIf you have had a kidney transplant and are taking immunosuppressant medications to prevent rejection, it is important to discuss all medications you are taking with your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider will be able to determine whether it is safe for you to take prochlorperazine along with your rejection medications and will be able to recommend the appropriate treatment for your specific situation.\n\nIn general, it is important to follow your healthcare provider's recommendations and to disclose all medications you are taking to your healthcare provider. This will help ensure that your treatment is safe and effective.<>medicine
