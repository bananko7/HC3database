What 's the difference between UBI and unemployment \/ welfare checks ? Are n't they both guaranteed income ? Explain like I'm five. 
Unemployment checks require that the receiver actively is looking for a job . It is common to require a certain number of rejection letters each week to get a full payout . Welfare checks often require regular doctors visits and if possible regular treatments to get better . UBI on the other hand does not have any requirements at all . You can even be in full work with a million dollar yearly steady income and still receive UBI on top of that . Of course you do not have to work that much before your taxes is greater then the UBI .
Unemployment benefits and welfare are both forms of government assistance that provide financial support to people who are unable to work or who have low incomes. The main difference between these programs and universal basic income (UBI) is that unemployment benefits and welfare are only available to certain people who meet certain eligibility requirements, such as being unemployed or having a low income.\\n\\nUniversal basic income, on the other hand, is a program that provides a guaranteed minimum income to everyone, regardless of their employment status or income level. The idea behind UBI is to provide a financial safety net for everyone, to help ensure that everyone has the resources they need to meet their basic needs and participate in society.\\n\\nSo, in summary, unemployment benefits and welfare are programs that provide financial assistance to specific groups of people who meet certain eligibility requirements, while universal basic income is a program that provides a guaranteed minimum income to everyone.
