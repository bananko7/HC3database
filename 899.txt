Please explain what is \"Ebola virus\"<>Zaire ebolavirus, more commonly known as Ebola virus (\/iˈboʊlə, ɪ-\/; EBOV), is one of six known species within the genus Ebolavirus. Four of the six known ebolaviruses, including EBOV, cause a severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and other mammals, known as Ebola virus disease (EVD). Ebola virus has caused the majority of human deaths from EVD, and was the cause of the 2013–2016 epidemic in western Africa, which resulted in at least 28,646 suspected cases and 11,323 confirmed deaths.\nEbola virus and its genus were both originally named for Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), the country where it was first described, and was at first suspected to be a new \"strain\" of the closely related Marburg virus. The virus was renamed \"Ebola virus\" in 2010 to avoid confusion. Ebola virus is the single member of the species Zaire ebolavirus, which is assigned to the genus Ebolavirus, family Filoviridae, order Mononegavirales. The members of the species are called Zaire ebolaviruses. The natural reservoir of Ebola virus is believed to be bats, particularly fruit bats, and it is primarily transmitted between humans and from animals to humans through body fluids.\nThe EBOV genome is a single-stranded RNA, approximately 19,000 nucleotides long. It encodes seven structural proteins: nucleoprotein (NP), polymerase cofactor (VP35), (VP40), GP, transcription activator (VP30), VP24, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L).[10]\nBecause of its high fatality rate (up to 83 to 90 percent),[11][12] EBOV is also listed as a select agent, World Health Organization Risk Group 4 Pathogen (requiring Biosafety Level 4-equivalent containment), a US National Institutes of Health\/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Category A Priority Pathogen, US CDC Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Category A Bioterrorism Agent, and a Biological Agent for Export Control by the Australia Group.[citation needed]<>Ebola virus is a viral illness that is caused by the Ebola virus. It is a highly infectious disease that can be fatal in humans and nonhuman primates, such as monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees. The Ebola virus is named after the Ebola River, which is located in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in Africa, where the virus was first identified in 1976.\n\n\n\nThe Ebola virus is transmitted to humans through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected animals, such as bats, primates, or humans. It can also be transmitted through sexual contact, breastfeeding, or the reuse of needles and syringes contaminated with the virus.\n\n\n\nSymptoms of Ebola virus disease (EVD) typically appear within 2 to 21 days after infection, although it can take up to 3 weeks for symptoms to appear. Early symptoms of EVD may include fever, fatigue, muscle pain, headache, and sore throat. As the disease progresses, it can cause vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and external bleeding from the eyes, ears, and nose. In severe cases, it can lead to organ failure and death.\n\n\n\nThere is no specific treatment for EVD, and the virus has a high mortality rate. Treatment is supportive and includes measures such as rehydration, electrolyte balance, and maintaining blood pressure. A vaccine is available to protect against the Ebola virus, and efforts are ongoing to develop new treatments and therapies.<>wiki_csai
