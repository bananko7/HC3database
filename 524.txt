Do Square credit card readers allow for personal use?<>I used square in the past for personal yard sale and they did not transfer balance to my bank acct because they told me it was against their policy and I had to have a business license that they could either refund the credit cards i process or keep the money. So they kept it I never got it back. I don't recommend anybody to use square.<>Yes, Square credit card readers are designed for personal use as well as for use by businesses.
