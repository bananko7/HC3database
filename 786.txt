How did we go from Old , to middle , then to modern English ? How can a language just change like that ? Explain like I'm five.<>Old English is Anglo - Saxon . The Angles and Saxons were Germanic tribes that moved to England and took their language with them . Their language was more similar to Germanic languages than Latin . Parts of it still survive today . It sounds NOTHING like English but if you listen carefully you [ can hear english words ] ( URL_0 ) Notice that at 1:14 ? , literally says \" That one good king \" or something really close to that . We can see the German influence in English really easily in [ this video ] ( URL_1 ) since they have a common origin . Now in 1066 , a french dude named William from the north coast of France conquered England . Since he was french , state affairs were conducted in french . Over time the influence grew more and more so you ended up with Middle English which starts to sound REALLY close to modern english , as you can hear in [ this video ] ( URL_2 ) Give it another 700 years of people starting to say and spell things differently , and you get the language you and I speak now !<>Great question! Languages are always changing and evolving over time, and English is no exception.\r\n\r\nEnglish has a long and complex history that stretches back over 1,500 years. It started as a language spoken by a group of people called the Anglo-Saxons who lived in what is now England. This language is known as Old English, and it is quite different from the English that we speak today.\r\n\r\nOver time, the English language changed and developed in many ways. For example, it was influenced by other languages such as Latin and French. As a result, the English language changed from Old English to Middle English, and then from Middle English to Modern English.\r\n\r\nOne way that languages change is through the influence of other languages. When two groups of people with different languages come into contact with each other, they may borrow words and phrases from each other's language. This is called \"borrowing,\" and it is a common way that languages change and evolve.\r\n\r\nAnother way that languages change is through the natural processes of language use. As people use a language, they may change the way they pronounce words, or they may create new words to describe new things or ideas. These changes can happen slowly over time, and they can result in a language that is very different from its original form.\r\n\r\nSo, to sum it up, English has changed over time because it has been influenced by other languages, and because it has changed naturally as it has been used by different groups of people.<>reddit_eli5
