Why do we need synonyms ? If accidently and inadvertently mean the same then why not just use one and not both ? ? Explain like I'm five.<>They do n't mean the same thing . They mean * * similar * * things . Accidentally : > by chance : without advance planning ; \" they met accidentally \" . Inadvertantly : > unwittingly : without knowledge or intention ; \" he unwittingly deleted the references \" One refers to planning , the other refers to intention . This is the case with * * most * * synonyms .<>Synonyms are words that have the same or similar meanings. We use synonyms to add variety to our writing and speaking, and to avoid repeating the same word over and over again. For example, instead of saying \"happy\" all the time, we can use words like \"joyful,\" \"pleased,\" or \"content\" to express the same idea.\n\nUsing synonyms can also help us be more precise and descriptive in our language. For example, \"accidentally\" and \"inadvertently\" might both mean that something happened by mistake, but they convey slightly different shades of meaning. \"Accidentally\" suggests that the event was unexpected or unintentional, while \"inadvertently\" suggests that the event was unintentional but might have been caused by carelessness or oversight.\n\nSo, even though \"accidentally\" and \"inadvertently\" are similar in meaning, they are not exactly the same, and using both of them can help us communicate more clearly and effectively. Does that make sense?<>reddit_eli5
