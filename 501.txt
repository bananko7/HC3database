Why do we say someone was ' hanged ' rather than someone was ' hung ' ? I just do n't get it . Explain like I'm five.<>In the wrong context , saying someone was hung could get you some weird looks .<>Great question! The difference between \"hanged\" and \"hung\" is one of tense. \"Hanged\" is the past tense of the verb \"hang,\" while \"hung\" is the past participle.\n\nWhen we use the verb \"hang\" in the past tense, we can either use \"hanged\" or \"hung.\" However, \"hanged\" is typically used when talking about execution by hanging, while \"hung\" is used in all other cases.\n\nFor example, you might say \"The thief was hanged for his crimes,\" or \"The picture was hung on the wall.\" In both of these cases, the verb \"hang\" is being used in the past tense, but the context is different, so we use the appropriate form of the verb.\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.<>reddit_eli5
