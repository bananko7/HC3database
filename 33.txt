How does a pill prescribed to you know exactly what to do in your body ? For example Advil gets absorbed into your stomach , then it stops a headache . How does that happen ? How does it know where to go ? Explain like I'm five. <>Pills do n't know anything . Your take medicine and your body will absorb it . It may be absorbed into the blood and travel all around your body . If you take a pain reliever , it is not targeting your headache but is dispersed through the whole body . The only noticeable change is that the pain goes away in the place that hurt . Researchers do not always know exactly how a drug works , either . They may use observation and trial & error to come up with a result in drug research , often in addition to previous experiences \/ research based on scientific methods .<>Pills are designed to work in specific ways in the body.

The bloodstream is like a river that flows throughout your body, carrying oxygen and nutrients to all of your cells. When the pill gets into your bloodstream, it travels to the parts of your body where it's needed.\\n\\nFor example, if you take a headache pill like Advil, it travels to your brain.
