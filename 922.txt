Why ca n't we see satellites from the ISS ? I was watching the live feed from the ISS and people are asking why ca n't we see satellites ? Explain like I'm five.<>The orbital path of satellites is a sphere significantly larger than * the entire Earth * . While there are thousands up there , most of them are the size of a car basically . You are n't going to just randomly see * anything * in space . It 's SO huge , if you 're not trying * really really hard * to find something , you never will . It 's like if you 're in the Sahara ATVing . You might wonder \" I ca n't be the only one ATVing in the Sahara , where is everyone \" . Well , the Sahara is 3.5 million square miles . It 's like finding a needle in a haystack , when the haystack is the size of 7 countries . It does n't matter if there 's 2000 needles , or 5 million . You probably wo n't see another one even if you search for the rest of your life .<>\\nIt's actually possible to see satellites from the International Space Station (ISS), but it can be difficult to spot them with the naked eye. This is because satellites are small and often move very quickly, making them hard to see against the background of space.\\n\\nAdditionally, the ISS is often in a lower orbit than many satellites, so the satellites may be above the ISS and therefore not visible from the ground.\\n\\nHowever, it is possible to see satellites if you know when and where to look, and if the conditions are right. For example, if you are in a dark location and the sky is clear, you might be able to spot a satellite as it reflects sunlight back to Earth.\\n\\nSatellites can also be seen using telescopes or other specialized equipment. Some people even use apps or websites that can help them track satellite movements and predict when and where they will be visible.\\n\\nSo, while it might not be easy to see satellites from the ISS or from the ground, it is possible if you know what you're looking for and have the right tools.<>reddit_eli5
