How were governments able to get away with testing nuclear weapons before Hiroshima and Nagasaki ? Would n't the fallout have been a huge screaming issue ? What happened to all that radiation ? Would n't people have noticed the bombs going off ? Explain like I'm five.<>Only one nuclear device was tested before Hiroshima and Nagasaki . This was the Trinity Test in the USA . It was done in the middle of no where . It 's not like the tested it in Central Park .<>Before the bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the United States and other countries had already conducted several nuclear weapon tests. These tests were typically carried out in remote areas, such as the desert or on isolated islands, to minimize the impact on people and the environment. However, even though the tests were conducted in remote areas, there was still some radiation fallout from the explosions, which could have potentially been harmful to people and wildlife.\r\n\r\nPeople would have noticed the bombs going off, but governments and military officials tried to keep these tests secret and did not always tell the public what was happening. They were able to get away with this because they had a lot of power and control, and they believed that the tests were necessary for national security reasons.\r\n\r\nAs for the radiation fallout, it is difficult to say exactly what happened to it, but it is likely that some of it dissipated into the atmosphere and some of it may have remained in the area where the tests were conducted. In some cases, governments may have taken steps to clean up or mitigate any potential harm from the radiation, but it is also possible that they did not do so. Overall, it is important to be cautious when conducting nuclear weapon tests and to ensure that measures are in place to minimize any potential risks to people and the environment.<>reddit_eli5
