For tinnitus - you need to do some basic exercise for reducing the ringing of years. this exercises I have tried over 12 years and many have got benefit from it. It slow process but good one. Try taking water in mouth and hold in the mouth and do cheek movement's. Try to do for as long as 1 minute. Jaw pain - for this the above one will help as there will be good amount of strength developing which will help ease the pain over the jaw as the ligament will get release of pressure. RA - in RA there is inflammation of the joints. Doing regular exercise and maintining the joint ROM and sufficient muscle strength is required to avoid pain. Most patients with RA have to undergo physiotherapy for improving the life style. also anti inflammatory medication will be provided by the Rheumatologist. Headache -  for this you need to mention that where exactly the pain is. because some are vascular, some are due to neck stiffness. Having a good physical examination should help assess the cause of headache and medication based on it. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

However, here are some general treatment options for the conditions you mentioned:\n\nRheumatoid arthritis: Treatment for rheumatoid arthritis typically involves a combination of medications and lifestyle changes. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) can help reduce inflammation and slow the progression of the disease. Physical therapy, exercise, and assistive devices such as canes or splints can also be helpful in managing the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nHeadache: There are many different types of headaches, and treatment will depend on the specific type and severity of the headache. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen can often be effective in relieving mild to moderate headaches. More severe headaches may require prescription medications or other treatments. It's important to speak with a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate treatment for your specific headache.\n\nJaw pain: Jaw pain can be caused by a variety of factors, including teeth grinding, jaw injury, or temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder. Treatment will depend on the underlying cause of the jaw pain. In some cases, over-the-counter pain relievers or ice packs can help reduce inflammation and relieve discomfort. Other treatments may include physical therapy, bite guards, or medication to relax the muscles in the jaw.\n\nLow blood pressure: Low blood pressure, also known as hypotension, can be caused by a variety of factors, including dehydration, certain medications, and underlying medical conditions. Treatment for low blood pressure may include increasing fluid intake, increasing salt intake, and taking medications to raise blood pressure. It's important to speak with a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate treatment for your specific case of low blood pressure.\n\nTinnitus: Tinnitus is the perception of noise or ringing in the ears that is not caused by an external source. There is no cure for tinnitus, but there are several treatment options that can help manage the symptoms. These may include sound therapy, counseling, and medications to relieve anxiety or depression. It's important to speak with a healthcare professional to determine the best treatment approach for your specific case of tinnitus.\n\nAgain, it's important to speak with a healthcare professional about your specific health concerns and treatment options. They will be able to take into account your individual circumstances and medical history to recommend the most appropriate treatment plan for you.<>medicine
