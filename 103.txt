It is commonly seen due to inflammation of tissues post-extraction, and at times swelling also occurs due to hematoma formation. So all the symptoms that he is facing are not abnormal and will get better in a period of about a week to ten days. So, for now, he should do cool compresses over the swelling. Take a combination of antibiotics like Augmentin and anti-inflammatory painkillers like Ibuprofen. After 48 hours start doing warm saline gargles. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Honey Arora<>Swelling and pain in the jaw following wisdom teeth extraction can be treated with over-the-counter pain medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. These medications can help to reduce swelling and alleviate pain. It is important to follow the dosing instructions on the bottle and not take more medication than recommended.\n\nApplying ice to the affected area can also help to reduce swelling. Place an ice pack on the outside of the jaw for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day.\n\nIf the pain or swelling is severe or does not improve after a few days, it is important to contact your son's dentist or oral surgeon. They may prescribe a stronger pain medication or recommend other treatment options.\n\nIt is also important for your son to follow the post-operative instructions provided by the dentist or oral surgeon, such as keeping the mouth clean, avoiding strenuous activity, and not drinking through a straw. These measures can help to ensure that the extraction site heals properly and reduce the risk of complications.<>medicine
