How can Argentina have a corporate tax of 137.3 % ? How exactly can a business make any money when taxes are well above 100 % ? ( Link within ) URL_0 Please explain like I'm five.<>That 's not what the article is saying . The article means for every dollar profit that an Argentinian company makes , the Government gets $ 1.37 in revenue , by the time it takes all the other taxes ( income , turnover , VAT \/ GST , payroll etc . )<>I'd be happy to help explain how corporate taxes work in Argentina.First, it's important to understand that the corporate tax rate is the percentage of a company's profits that it must pay in taxes to the government. In Argentina, the corporate tax rate is currently 37.3%.Now, let's say that a company in Argentina makes a profit of $100. The government would require the company to pay 37.3% of that profit in taxes, which would be $37.30.But in Argentina, there are also additional taxes that companies must pay on top of the corporate tax. These additional taxes are known as \"surcharges,\" and they can bring the total tax rate up to 137.3%.So, for example, if a company has to pay an additional 100% in surcharges on top of the corporate tax, it would have to pay a total of $74.60 in taxes on its $100 in profits. This means that the company would only be left with $25.40 of its original $100 in profits after paying taxes.I hope this helps to clarify how corporate taxes work in Argentina. Let me know if you have any more questions!<>reddit_eli5
