Explain like I'm five.<>The scars and stretch marks are disfigurements etched into the dermis . The skin \" we are always shedding and growing \" is a layer of skin above the dermis , the Epidermis . URL_0 URL_1<>Scars and stretch marks are different from the normal skin cells that are constantly being shed and replaced. Scars are formed when the skin is injured and the body repairs the damage by creating a scar. Stretch marks are formed when the skin is stretched rapidly, such as during puberty or pregnancy.\r\n\r\nThe body's healing process creates scars and stretch marks by producing extra collagen, which is a protein that helps to repair and strengthen the skin. When the skin is injured, the body sends extra blood to the area to help repair the damage. This can cause the skin to become red and swollen. As the skin starts to heal, new collagen is produced to help repair the damaged tissue.\r\n\r\nOver time, the redness and swelling will go away, but the scar or stretch mark may remain. This is because the scar or stretch mark is made up of different types of collagen and other proteins that are arranged in a different way than the normal skin cells.\r\n\r\nSo even though your body is constantly shedding and growing new skin cells, the scars and stretch marks remain because they are a different type of tissue that is not replaced in the same way.<>Scars and stretch marks are different from the normal skin cells that are constantly being shed and replaced.
