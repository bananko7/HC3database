I cosigned for a friend who is not paying the payment<>If the bank is calling your employer, the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) limits where and when debt collectors can contact consumer debtors. In many cases, debt collectors that contact debtors at work are violating the FDCPA. http:\/\/www.nolo.com\/legal-encyclopedia\/a-debt-collector-calling-me-work-is-allowed.html<>If you cosigned for a loan or credit card for a friend and they are not paying the payments, you are responsible for paying the debt. As a cosigner, you are equally responsible for the debt as the primary borrower and the lender can hold you responsible for the payments if the primary borrower fails to pay. This means that the lender can pursue you for the unpaid balances and take legal action against you to recover the debt.It is important to understand the risks of cosigning before agreeing to do so. If you are considering cosigning for a friend, it is a good idea to have a candid conversation about their financial situation and their ability to make the payments on time. You should also be prepared to pay the debt yourself if necessary.If you are unable to pay the debt and your credit is being affected, you may want to consider trying to negotiate with the lender to have the debt removed from your credit report. In some cases, the lender may be willing to do this if the primary borrower agrees to take full responsibility for the debt and makes arrangements to pay it off.If you are unable to resolve the issue with the lender, you may need to seek legal advice to explore your options. An attorney may be able to help you negotiate with the lender or pursue other legal remedies.<>finance
