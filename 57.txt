How can the ROE on a stock be more than 100%?<>A company's Return on Equity (ROE) is its net income divided by its shareholder's equity.  The shareholder's equity is the difference between total assets and total liabilities, and is not dependent on the stock price. What it takes to have a ROE over 100% is to have the income be greater than the equity.  This might happen for a variety of reasons, but one way a high ROE happens is if the shareholder's equity (the divisor) is small, which can occur if past losses have eroded the company's capital (the original invested cash and retained earnings).  If the equity has become a small value, the income for some period might exceed it, and so the ROE would be over 100%. Operating margin is not closely related to ROE.  Although operating income is related to net income, to calculate the margin you divide by sales, which is completely unrelated to shareholder's equity.  So there is no relationship with ROE to be expected.  Operating margin is primarily dependent on market conditions, and can be substantially different in different industries.<>It is possible for a company's return on equity (ROE) to be more than 100%. ROE is a measure of the profitability of a company in relation to the equity of its shareholders. It is calculated by dividing the net income of the company by the shareholder equity.There are a few ways that a company's ROE could be more than 100%. One possibility is that the company has a very high net income relative to its shareholder equity. This could be the result of strong financial performance or a low level of equity relative to the size of the company.Another possibility is that the company has negative shareholder equity. In this case, the ROE would be calculated by dividing the net income by a negative number, which would result in a ROE that is greater than 100%. This could occur if the company has accumulated a large amount of debt or if it has incurred significant losses in the past.It is important to note that a high ROE does not necessarily indicate that a company is a good investment. There are many factors that can affect a company's financial performance and ROE, and it is important to consider a range of financial metrics when evaluating an investment.<>finance
