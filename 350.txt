Back in the day, CDs had a much lower storage capacity than they do today. Nowadays, CDs can hold much more data, so developers can fit more content onto one CD.\r\n\r\nGames are getting smaller: Another reason why modern PC games can fit on one CD is that games are getting smaller in size. This is because developers are using more efficient methods to create and store game assets. For example, instead of using high-resolution textures, they might use lower-resolution textures that still look good but take up less space.\r\n\r\nGames are being distributed digitally: Finally, a lot of modern PC games are being distributed digitally, which means that you don't need a physical CD to play them. Instead, you can download the game directly from the internet and play it on your computer. This means that developers don't have to worry about fitting the game onto a CD at all, which allows them to include more content in the game.\r\n\r\nSo, to sum it up, modern PC games can fit on one CD because technology has improved, games are getting smaller, and they are being distributed digitally.<>reddit_eli5
