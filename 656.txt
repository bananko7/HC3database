Dry heat I 've lived on the east coast my whole life and I just can not wrap my brain around the feeling of dry heat . Explain like I'm five.<>Dry heat is heat with low humidity . The cliche is that a dry heat does n't feel as bad as humid heat . The truth to that is when someone sweats and the sweat is evaporated into the surrounding air the heat on the skin is reduced slightly producing a cooling effect . In humid heat the body tries to cool itself by sweating but the sweat is not as easily evaporated due to the amount of water already saturated in the air , thus no cooling effect . Having lived in both Florida and Arizona at different times I can tell you from experience that 90 degrees Fahrenheit in Florida is more uncomfortable than 110 degrees in Arizona . Now , dry * heaves * on the other hand , usually involve alcohol .<>Sure! Dry heat is when the air is hot, but it doesn't have a lot of moisture in it. Moisture is the tiny drops of water that you can feel in the air when it's humid outside. When the air is dry, it doesn't feel as sticky or heavy, and you might not sweat as much. It's kind of like if you put your hand near a heater. The air around the heater might feel hot, but it's dry and doesn't have any moisture in it. That's what dry heat feels like. Does that make sense?<>reddit_eli5
