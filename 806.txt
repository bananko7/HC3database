Does the total fertility supplement will increase?I have unregularly period because I have PCOS I had took birth control for 12 months but when I had stopped taking them my period was regular for just three months my 4th one is late now.. I  was wondering if I should take something else now ? and if the total fertility supplement PCOS will help in my case ? I will appreciate your kind answer I'm  really tired because of this ...thank you<>Hi.Treatment for PCOS begins with weight loss and metformin, if either or both are indicated, and then is individualized depending on the patient's reproductive needs: oral contraception supplemented with antiandrogen therapy for patients not wishing to conceive or fertility treatments for patients desiring pregnancy.To reinforce weight reduction+\/- metformin is the recommended therapy.Role of fertility supplements is questionable.Consult your obstetrician for further management.Hope this helps.Take care.<>It's understandable that you're feeling frustrated and tired of dealing with irregular periods due to PCOS. It's important to speak with a healthcare provider about your options for managing your PCOS and regulating your menstrual cycle.\n\nThe total fertility supplement you mentioned may not be appropriate for you, as it is marketed as a supplement to support fertility in women trying to conceive. If your goal is to regulate your menstrual cycle, you may want to discuss other options with your healthcare provider.\n\nThere are a variety of treatment options available for managing PCOS and regulating menstrual cycles. These may include birth control pills, other types of hormonal contraceptives, and medications to regulate insulin levels or androgens (male hormones). Your healthcare provider can help you determine the best treatment option for you based on your specific needs and goals.\n\nIt's also important to note that lifestyle changes, such as maintaining a healthy weight and engaging in regular physical activity, can also help manage PCOS and regulate menstrual cycles. Your healthcare provider may recommend these interventions in addition to medication or as a standalone treatment option.\n\nIn summary, it's important to speak with a healthcare provider about your options for managing PCOS and regulating your menstrual cycle. They can help you determine the best course of treatment for your specific needs and goals.<>medicine
