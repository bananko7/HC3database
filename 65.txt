Is genetic diversity almost always a good thing ? For example people of different races or ethnic background , do they usually breed genetically stronger offspring ? Being that the genetic code has more resources available when creating said human ? Explain like I'm five.<>The most important effect in this is not necessarily that different ethnicities create * better * offspring , but that the genetic defects that permeate individual populations are far less likely to be present in both parents if they are from different populations . It means that children with mixed ethnicities are less likely to express those defects because they have received a \" healthy \" chromosome from one of their parents . They can still pass on the defective one to their children however and it takes a few child generations for the defect to become less and less prevalent<>\\nGenetic diversity is generally considered to be a good thing because it can help a population adapt to changing environments and resist diseases. This is because individuals with different genetic backgrounds may have different traits that are advantageous in different situations. For example, some people may be more resistant to certain diseases because of their genetic makeup, while others may be more adept at surviving in certain environments.\\n\\nWhen different people with different genetic backgrounds have children, their offspring will have a combination of the genetic traits of both parents. This can sometimes result in offspring that are more genetically diverse and potentially more adaptable to different environments. However, it is important to note that there is no guarantee that offspring will be \"stronger\" or more fit just because they have more genetic diversity. The specific combination of genes that an individual has will determine their traits and characteristics, and it is impossible to predict how these genes will interact with one another.\\n\\nOverall, genetic diversity can be beneficial for a population because it can increase the chances that some individuals will have traits that are advantageous in different situations. However, it is important to remember that genetics is just one factor that can affect an individual's traits and characteristics, and there is no single \"perfect\" combination of genes.<>reddit_eli5
