What is the purpose of a water tower ? Backup storage ? Pressure management ? Hopefully a public works person can explain ... Please explain like I'm five.<>It 's backup storage that does n't require power to redistribute . The weight of the stored water provides enough force to distribute the water from the tower to the grid if necessary .<>A water tower is a tall, cylindrical tank that is used to store water. It is usually found in areas where the water pressure in the local water pipes is not strong enough to deliver water to buildings and homes. \nThe water tower helps to solve this problem by storing a large amount of water at a higher elevation than the buildings and homes. This allows the water to flow downward, through the pipes, and into the buildings and homes under the force of gravity. This is called \"gravity feed.\" \nWater towers also help to maintain a consistent water pressure in the pipes. When a lot of water is being used at the same time (for example, when people are taking showers or flushing toilets), the water pressure can drop. Having a water tower helps to ensure that there is always a reserve of water available to meet the demand, so the water pressure stays stable. \nIn summary, water towers are used to store water and to help with the delivery of water to buildings and homes, as well as to maintain a consistent water pressure in the pipes.<>reddit_eli5
