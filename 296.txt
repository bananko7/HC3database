Are solar cell panels and wind mills worth the money?<>Solar water heaters are definitely questionable in the Northeast -- the season when you most need them is also the season when they are least effective. Solar electric isn't a huge moneymaker, but with rebates on installation and carbon-reduction credits (SRECs) -- and a group purchase discount if you can get one, either at a town level or through organizations like One Block Off The Grid -- it can definitely turn a profit. Early estimate was that my setup would pay its initial costs back in 4 years, and the panels are generally considered to be good for a decade before the cells have degraded enough that the panels should be replaced. I haven't had a negative electric bill yet, but I've gotten close, and my setup is a relatively small one (eight panels facing SSE on a 45-degree roof). Admittedly I've also been working to reduce electricity use; I don't think I have an incandescent bulb left in the house.<>Solar panels and wind turbines can be a good investment for homeowners, businesses, and communities that are looking to reduce their energy costs and their carbon footprint. The financial returns on solar panels and wind turbines depend on a variety of factors, including the local climate, the availability of sunlight and wind, the cost of electricity from the grid, and the cost of financing the installation.Solar panels are a good investment in areas with high levels of sunlight, as they can generate a significant amount of electricity. The cost of installing solar panels has decreased significantly in recent years, and many states and localities offer incentives and financing options to help offset the upfront cost. In general, solar panels have a payback period of around 5-10 years, after which they will generate free electricity for the remainder of their lifetime (which is typically around 25 years).Wind turbines are a good investment in areas with high average wind speeds. The cost of installing wind turbines has also decreased in recent years, and there are also various incentives and financing options available to help offset the upfront cost. The payback period for wind turbines is typically longer than for solar panels, but they can generate electricity for a longer period of time (up to 20 years or more).In summary, solar panels and wind turbines can be a good investment if they are cost-effective and if they meet the energy needs of the homeowner, business, or community. It is important to do your research and to carefully consider the costs and benefits before making a decision to invest in solar panels or wind turbines.<>finance
