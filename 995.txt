Massachusetts , Pennsylvania , Virginia , and Kentucky are known as a “ CommonWealth ” but what exactly does that mean in the grand scheme ? Google has failed me and I ca n’t really understand the point so please ... ELI5 What is a CommonWealth ? Explain like I'm five. <>Nothing , really . It was just the term they picked to describe themselves . There 's an idea that , at the time , \" commonwealth \" was more a more republican term , but it makes no difference in the long run .<>A \"commonwealth\" is a political entity in which the people have a say in how the government is run. It is similar to a democracy, where the people have the power to elect their leaders and make decisions about how the community is run. The term \"commonwealth\" is often used to describe a group of states that have joined together for a common purpose, such as the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the Commonwealth of Kentucky. These states are called \"commonwealths\" because they are united under a single system of government and work together for the common good of their citizens.<>reddit_eli5
