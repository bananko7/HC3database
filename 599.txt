Why are n't deserts totally covered in solar panels ? Even considering difficulties in transporting captured solar energy , it still seems like a pretty solid return on investment . Are the obstacles purely political , or can we not build in the desert for another reason ? Explain like I'm five.<>Deserts are ecosystems too ! We can cover large swathes of it with solar panels but destroying an entire ecosystem would be counterintuitive . We can also build on deserts and they are full of another kind of fuel , which would incur much less start - up costs . So all in all , bad idea . EDIT : my spelling is shite , sorry .<>There are a few reasons why we don't see more solar panels in the desert. One reason is that solar panels need to be connected to the electrical grid in order to be able to provide electricity to homes and businesses. In some desert areas, it can be difficult and expensive to build the infrastructure needed to connect the solar panels to the grid. Another reason is that deserts can be very hot and dry, which can cause the solar panels to degrade over time. Finally, some desert areas are protected as national parks or are home to wildlife that could be disrupted by the construction of solar panel farms.<>reddit_eli5
