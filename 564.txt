If the brain has no pain receptors , what is the deal with headaches \/ migraines ? If the brain has no pain receptors ( i.e. brain surgery is performed while the patient is awake ) , what is the deal when we have headaches and migraines then ? Please explain like I'm five.<>The brain itself lacks pain receptors , however there are structures around it which have pain receptors , muscles , arteries , nerves , veins , and so on .<>Although the brain itself doesn't have pain receptors, it is surrounded by various tissues and structures that do have them. These tissues and structures include blood vessels, muscles, and nerves that are located in and around the brain, as well as the tissues lining the skull and the tissues that cover the brain (called the meninges). Headaches and migraines are caused by irritation or inflammation of these tissues and structures, which can be triggered by a variety of things such as stress, certain foods, changes in weather, and certain medications. When these tissues and structures become irritated or inflamed, they can send pain signals to the brain, which can cause a headache or a migraine. So, even though the brain itself doesn't have pain receptors, it can still experience pain through the tissues and structures that surround it.<>reddit_eli5
