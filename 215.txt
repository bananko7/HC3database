How was the first programming language made before any language existed ? I mean how do we program programming languages and how was it possible before they were even made ? Explain like I'm five.<>binary . Basic computers were just a bunch of switches that you turned on and off to get intended results .<>That's a really interesting question!, Before programming languages were invented, people used something called machine code to give instructions to computers. Machine code is a series of numbers that tell the computer what to do. However, machine code is very hard for people to read and write because it is just a bunch of numbers. To make it easier for people to program computers, the first programming languages were invented. These programming languages were made by people, and they used a combination of English words and special symbols to make it easier for people to write instructions for computers. So, the first programming languages were made by people who used machine code to create a new way of giving instructions to computers that was easier for humans to understand. Does that make sense? Do you have any more questions about programming languages?<>reddit_eli5
