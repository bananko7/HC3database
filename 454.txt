ELI : Why are fax machines still a thing ? When we have scanners and email which are better in so many ways . Explain like I'm five.<>Because not everyone who needs documents signed has computers . In many ways if you need a piece of paper that has a signature , sending it from machine that reads paper directly to machine that prints paper could certainly be more efficient . SO the main reason is that we 're still dependent on paper records for things , and this is a good way to send them . The machines themselves are often terrible , but the concept is still necessary .<>Fax machines are still a thing because some people and organizations still use them to send documents. A fax machine works by sending a document through a phone line to another fax machine, which prints out a copy of the document. This can be useful because it is a quick and easy way to send a hard copy of a document to someone who is not physically with you.\n\nScanners and email are also good ways to send documents, but they have some limitations. For example, if you want to send a document to someone who does not have a computer or an email account, you might not be able to use email. A fax machine can still send the document to their fax machine, even if they don't have a computer.\n\nOverall, fax machines are still used because they can be a simple and reliable way to send documents, especially for certain types of businesses and organizations.<>reddit_eli5
