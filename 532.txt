Please explain what is \"Quantified self\"<>The quantified self refers both to the cultural phenomenon of self-tracking with technology and to a community of users and makers of self-tracking tools who share an interest in \"self-knowledge through numbers\". Quantified self practices overlap with the practice of lifelogging and other trends that incorporate technology and data acquisition into daily life, often with the goal of improving physical, mental, and emotional performance. The widespread adoption in recent years of wearable fitness and sleep trackers such as the Fitbit or the Apple Watch, combined with the increased presence of Internet of things in healthcare and in exercise equipment, have made self-tracking accessible to a large segment of the population.\nOther terms for using self-tracking data to improve daily functioning are auto-analytics, body hacking, self-quantifying, self-surveillance, sousveillance (recording of personal activity), and personal informatics.<>The quantified self is a movement that emphasizes the use of personal data and technology to track, analyze, and understand one's own behavior and habits. It involves collecting data about oneself, often through the use of wearable devices or smartphone apps, and using this data to gain insights into one's own health, productivity, and overall well-being. The goal of the quantified self movement is to empower individuals to make informed decisions about their lives by providing them with a more complete understanding of their own behavior and habits.\n\n\n\nThe type of data that can be collected and analyzed as part of the quantified self movement is wide-ranging and can include things like physical activity, sleep patterns, diet and nutrition, heart rate, mood, and even things like productivity and time management. Many people who are interested in the quantified self movement use wearable devices like fitness trackers or smartwatches to collect data about their activity levels, sleep patterns, and other aspects of their health and wellness. They may also use apps or other software tools to track and analyze this data, and to set goals and monitor their progress over time.\n\n\n\nOverall, the quantified self movement is about using data and technology to better understand and improve one's own health, productivity, and overall well-being. It is a way for individuals to take control of their own lives and make informed decisions about how to live healthier and more productive lives.<>wiki_csai
