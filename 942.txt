how is ASP.NET different from .NET<>ASP.NET is a server-side Web application framework designed for Web development to produce dynamic Web pages .<>ASP.NET is a web application framework developed by Microsoft that allows developers to build dynamic websites, web applications, and web services. It is built on top of the .NET framework, which provides a runtime environment for executing code written in various .NET languages, such as C# and VB.NET.\\n\\nThe .NET framework is a general-purpose software development platform that includes a common runtime, a set of libraries, and a set of language compilers. It is designed to be used for building a wide variety of applications, including desktop applications, mobile apps, and web applications.\\n\\nASP.NET is specifically designed for building web applications, and it includes a number of features and tools that make it easier to build and deploy web applications, such as a built-in web server, a framework for building web pages and web services, and support for integrating with databases and other data sources.\\n\\nIn summary, ASP.NET is a framework built on top of the .NET framework that is specifically designed for building web applications. .NET, on the other hand, is a general-purpose software development platform that can be used to build a wide variety of applications.","ASP.NET is a web application framework developed by Microsoft that runs on the .NET platform. It allows developers to build dynamic web applications, websites, and web services using the .NET framework.\\n\\n.NET is a software framework developed by Microsoft that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows. It includes a large class library known as the Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides language interoperability (each language can use code written in other languages) across several programming languages.\\n\\nIn short, .NET is a framework for building and running applications, while ASP.NET is a framework for building and running web applications specifically.","ASP.NET is a web application framework developed by Microsoft that runs on the .NET platform.
