why can we go East \/ West forever but when we go North we eventually end up going South ? Feel like there 's actually interesting maths \/ geometry behind this for some reason Explain like I'm five.<>> Feel like there 's actually interesting maths \/ geometry behind this for some reason There is , but I think it 's * way * beyond ELI5 . You 're asking why a sphere has poles , and the answer is because we usually measure a sphere using Euler angles ( rotations about 3 orthoginal axies ) . We use Euler angles because they 're intuitive and historically the way it was done , but the problem is that they are n't valid at certain points ie the poles . Until recently ( literally the last 100 years ) while everybody knew there was a problem , it was purely academic and no - one cared that it did n't work at some points . The formal and not - at - all ELI5 answer is that there is no trivial covering map projecting from the T^3 torus to a real sphere R^3 . That might be more intuitive to say that there is no way to map every point on a sphere to a plane . To imagine it in 1 dimension , imagine a semi - circle sitting on a number line , like a sideways D. You want to map from any point on the semicircle to exactly one point on the line and vice versa . The obvious way to do this is to draw a line from the top of the semicircle , crossing down through the semicircle and cutting its edge somewhere , and continuing on until it cuts the number line . Where that line cuts the semicircle and the number line maps any point on the semicircle to exactly one point on the line , and every point on the number line to exactly one point on the semicircle , EXCEPT the top of the circle which would map to infinity , but also to -infinity , hence it 's ambiguous . This is the crinkle in mapping from the surface of a sphere to a plane in 2D that prevents everything working nicely , and means you have to have spots where it all goes to shit and forms a pole . This has real world applications beyond just \" going north from north \" . In mechanics , especially in [ Gimbal Lock ] ( URL_1 ) of gyros , which damn - near destroyed both Apollo 11 and Apollo 13 before NASA learned their lesson and upgraded the gyros to 4 - axis ones , but also in things like robotics and controlling CNC tools The solution is to use a non - trivial mapping like [ quaternions ] ( URL_0 ) ( also beyond ELI5 , but you know the magic word to google ) . The Wikipedia page is unintuitive - like all mathematics wikipedia pages - but it 's the first thing that came up when I searched Someone who is better at being a mathematics communicator might have a better analogy for the topology mapping<>\\nThe reason we can go east or west forever but eventually end up going south when we go north is because of the way the Earth is shaped. The Earth is a sphere, which means it is round like a ball.\\n\\nIf you were to start at the North Pole and walk in any direction, you would eventually end up back at the North Pole, because the Earth is round. This is because the Earth is curved, and as you walk in a straight line, you are following the curve of the Earth.\\n\\nIf you were to walk in a straight line to the east or west, you would never reach the edge of the Earth because the Earth is so big. However, if you were to walk in a straight line to the north, you would eventually reach the North Pole, because that is the highest point on the Earth's surface.\\n\\nSo, to sum it up, the Earth is shaped like a ball, and that's why we can go east or west forever, but eventually end up going south when we go north.\\n<>reddit_eli5
