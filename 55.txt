How exactly do we hear our thoughts ? As in when we hear a voice in our head , how are we hearing it without an actual sound being emitted , and what is going on when this happens ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Our thoughts , as we hear them , are primarily input . When you think , you 're probably just bypassing the part that requires you to hear the input and simply gives a direct link .<>When you hear a voice in your head, it's actually just your brain creating the experience of sound. It's kind of like how a computer can create images on a screen or how a television can play a movie. Your brain is able to create the experience of sound without any actual sound waves being produced. \nWhen you think about something, your brain sends signals to different parts of your body to help you remember and process the information. This can include sending signals to the muscles in your mouth and throat to help you say the words out loud or to the muscles in your inner ear to help you hear the words in your head. \nIt's important to remember that hearing your thoughts is a normal part of the way your brain works. It's a way for your brain to help you think and process information.<>reddit_eli5
