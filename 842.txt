Mormons and Mormonism ? I had never heard of the term until I read A Study in Scarlet last week . I tried to Google it but I did n't understand a thing . Please explain like I'm five.<>Christianity = Bible Mormonism = Bible + [ Book of Mormon ] ( URL_0 ) In a nutshell . It 's not really that simple , but that 's the foundation for both religions .<>Mormons are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a religious group that originated in the United States in the early 1800s. The church was founded by a man named Joseph Smith, who claimed to have received visions from God and to have discovered ancient texts that contained the teachings of Jesus. Mormonism is the set of beliefs and practices followed by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The core beliefs of Mormonism include the belief in God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit as separate beings; the belief that Jesus is the savior of the world; and the belief that the Bible and other holy texts, such as the Book of Mormon, contain the teachings of God. Mormons place a strong emphasis on living a moral, virtuous life and on following Jesus's teachings. They also believe in the importance of missionary work, or sharing their beliefs with others, and in the concept of \"eternal families,\" or the belief that families can be together forever through the practice of temple ordinances. I hope this helps give you a basic understanding of Mormons and Mormonism. Let me know if you have any other questions.<>reddit_eli5
