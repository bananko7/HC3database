Plato 's Allegory of the Cave It 's not for school or anything , I 'm just really interested and every explanation confuses me . Explain like I'm five.<>So the allegory ( shortly ) goes like this : You have a bunch of people tied up in a cave in such a way that they ca n't see each other , all they can see is a cave wall . Behind them is a source of light , and between them and the light are various people going about their business . Now the tied up people 's only view of the world is the shadows made on the wall , so they view that as the truth , the real world is just shadow to them . But one of these guys eventually breaks lose , and he can see that the shadows are n't the full truth , they are just representations . He 's \" seen the light \" ( literally in this case ) . Now having figured this out he tries to tell the other guys what 's going on . The problem is that some of them are very comfortable in the shadow world . Some have even become famous for their understanding of the shadows on the wall . So they heavily resist this new idea . The enlightened guy then physically tries to show them the truth , by removing the ropes that bind them , but they are so adamant about the shadow world and their place in it , that they kill the enlightened man . This story is really about the story of Socrates , and philosophers in general . How they have become enlightened , but live in an unenlightened world , and they will often find resistance ( sometimes violent ) to their ideas .<>Sure! The Allegory of the Cave is a story that Plato, a famous philosopher, told a long time ago. It's about a group of people who have been living in a cave since they were born. They have never been outside the cave, so they don't know what the world is really like.\r\n\r\nIn the cave, there is a fire burning, and the people are chained so they can only look straight ahead at the wall in front of them. Behind them, there are people walking around and carrying objects. The people in the cave can see the shadows of these objects on the wall in front of them, but they don't know what the objects actually are.\r\n\r\nPlato used this story to explain that the things we see and experience in the world are just like the shadows on the wall. They are not the real things. The real things are the things that are behind us, just like the people and objects in the cave.\r\n\r\nSo, the Allegory of the Cave is a way of saying that we don't really understand the world and the things in it. We only understand the shadows of those things, or the ideas that we have in our minds about them.\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense? Let me know if you have any questions.<>Sure!
