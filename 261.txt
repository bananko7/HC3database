Vitamins Since we largely do n't eat healthy , why does n't everyone just take vitamins ? Please explain like I'm five.<>Most people in the US at least get sufficient nutrients in their diet . However , they also tend to eat excessive calories , fat , and salt which is what leads to health problems .<>Vitamins are essential nutrients that our bodies need to function properly. They help us to grow and stay healthy, and they can be found in a variety of foods. While it is important to get enough of these nutrients, it is not a good idea to rely solely on vitamin supplements to meet all of your nutritional needs. This is because vitamins from food sources are often more easily absorbed and utilized by the body than those from supplements. Additionally, some vitamins and minerals can be harmful if taken in large amounts, so it is important to speak with a healthcare provider before starting any supplement regimen. It is also important to eat a healthy and varied diet that includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other nutrient-rich foods to ensure that you are getting all of the nutrients that your body needs.<>reddit_eli5
