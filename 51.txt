What is causing the death of Kmart ? I saw an article showing pictures of empty Kmarts and it made me wonder what is causing such a large chain 's slow death . Please explain like I'm five.
Kmart is losing to superior competitors in its field . It 's a discount department store , and it competes against brands like Fred Meyer , Target , and Walmart . Target is beating them on customer service , media exclusives , and hip - but - affordable clothing and household items . Walmart beats them on size , variety of in - store services , outdoors \/ sporting goods , pharmacy services , and open hours . Both Target and Walmart tend to beat Kmart on price . Target also dominates in urban areas , especially with its new City Targets , and Walmart dominates in rural areas . Fred Meyer is popular due to its variety and large grocery sections , as well as its frequent coupon sales . So where does that leave Kmart ? They are n't the cheapest , they do n't have the nicest merchandise , they do n't have the best customer service , they do n't have other non - shopping services , and they do n't have much variety . Essentially , they have no advantage over their competitors . Their only recent innovation was to bring back layaway services , but now their competitors do it as well .
Kmart is a retail chain that has been struggling financially in recent years. There are several reasons why Kmart has been struggling, including: \n1. Competition from other retailers: Kmart has faced stiff competition from other retailers, such as Walmart and Target, which have been able to offer lower prices and a wider range of products. \n2. Changes in consumer behavior: Many people have started shopping online instead of going to physical stores, and Kmart has not been able to keep up with this shift in consumer behavior. \n3. Financial problems: Kmart has had financial problems for many years, including bankruptcy in 2002. This has made it difficult for the company to invest in new stores and keep up with its competitors. \n4. Lack of innovation: Kmart has not been able to keep up with changes in the retail industry, such as the rise of e-commerce and the increasing importance of customer experience. This has made it difficult for the company to attract and retain customers. \nOverall, Kmart's slow death is the result of a combination of factors, including competition, changes in consumer behavior, financial problems, and a lack of innovation.
