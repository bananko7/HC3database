ELIM5 : why are n't Russians called Asians when most of Asia is Russia ? If you want to throw in some background about what an Oriental is please go ahead . Explain like I'm five.<>Most of the * people * in Russia live in the part of Russia that is considered to be part of Europe . Most cartographers put the divide between Europe and Asia at the Ural Mountains , the northwest border of Kazakhstan , and the Caspian Sea . [ See ? ] ( URL_0 )<>Russia is a country in both Europe and Asia. It is the largest country in the world and it stretches all the way from the European continent to the Pacific Ocean. It is considered part of both Europe and Asia because it is located in both regions of the world. The term \"Asian\" is often used to refer to people from the continent of Asia, which is a large landmass that includes countries like China, Japan, and India. Because Russia is part of both Europe and Asia, it is not correct to call Russians \"Asians\" exclusively. Instead, we can say that they are a part of both the European and Asian continents. \"Oriental\" is a term that is sometimes used to refer to people or things from the eastern part of the world, but it is not a very common term and many people find it offensive.<>reddit_eli5
