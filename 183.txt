Is Electricity Matter ? Why or why Not ? I recently had a n argument with a friend over this and we both realized we do n't know shit . Help . Please explain like I'm five.<>There 's no universally agreed upon meaning for \" matter \" . It 's just not a defined scientific concept . If you follow the simplistic definition of matter as a substance that makes up physical objects , then no . Electricity is n't made of atoms . However , electricity itself is caused by the movement of electrons , which have a rest mass , and are therefore technically \" matter \" under a looser definition . Electromagnetic fields , on the other hand , are fields , and can be in no way construed to be matter . So I 'm going to have to say no , electricity is n't matter . Keep in mind , this is based only upon a high - school level understanding of physics , so take it with a grain of salt .<>Electricity is a form of energy, but it is not matter. Matter is made up of atoms and molecules, and it has mass and occupies space. Electricity, on the other hand, is a flow of charged particles, usually electrons, through a conductor. It does not have mass and does not occupy space in the same way that matter does. To understand electricity, it can be helpful to think of it like water flowing through a pipe. Just as water flows through a pipe to carry energy, electricity flows through wires to carry energy. The difference is that electricity is made up of tiny particles, while water is made up of molecules. I hope this helps to clarify the difference between electricity and matter. Let me know if you have any other questions!<>reddit_eli5
