The purpose of a $ 1 salary Just read that Mark Zuckerberg is on a $ 1 \/ year salary .... how and why ? Please explain like I'm five.<>It 's a tradition among the tech giants in silicon valley to have a $ 1 a year salary . They own such a big share of the company they are worth billions so putting them on a $ 200k \/ year salary is stupid because it 's in their best intentions to make the company work .<>Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and CEO of Facebook, has a salary of $1 per year. This means that he only receives a very small amount of money for his work as the CEO of the company. There are a few reasons why someone like Mark Zuckerberg might choose to have a $1 salary. One reason is that he is already very wealthy, so he doesn't need a high salary to support himself. Another reason might be that he wants to show that he is not motivated by money, and that he is focused on the mission of the company instead. Finally, having a $1 salary can also be a way for someone to show that they are committed to the success of the company, and that they are willing to make sacrifices for the good of the company.<>reddit_eli5
