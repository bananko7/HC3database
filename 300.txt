can someone explain terraforming ? What I have read is that it is making another planet habitable ? Not sure if I get it Explain like I'm five.<>So you know how climate change will increase the temperature on Earth ? Well imagine intentionally emitting massive quantities of greenhouse gases on another planet ( especially Mars ) to increase the temperature to something warm enough for humans to live on . That s just a small part of terraforming , but the basic idea is you can make a planet more habitable by changing its climate .<>Terraforming is the process of changing the environment of a planet or moon so that it is more suitable for humans to live on. This could involve things like creating an atmosphere that is breathable for humans, changing the temperature of the planet so that it is not too hot or too cold, or adding water to the planet so that there is a supply of liquid for plants and animals. The goal of terraforming is to make it possible for humans to live on a planet or moon that is currently inhospitable for life as we know it. It is a process that would take a long time and would require a lot of resources, but it is something that some scientists and engineers have thought about as a way to potentially make other planets in our solar system more habitable for humans in the future.<>reddit_eli5
