They are usually found in areas where there is no access to a central sewage system, such as in rural areas or in some older neighborhoods.\\n\\nInside the septic tank, bacteria break down the solid waste and other organic matter in the sewage. The treated water is then released into a drain field, where it is further treated by bacteria in the soil before it is returned to the environment.\\n\\nSeptic tanks are used in many countries around the world, not just in the United States. However, they are more common in the United States because many areas do not have access to central sewage systems. In the United Kingdom and other countries, it is more common to have a central sewage system that connects homes and businesses to a treatment plant.\\n\\nIn summary, septic tanks are used to treat and store sewage and wastewater in areas where there is no access to a central sewage system. They are found in many countries, including the United States, but are less common in other countries because they have central sewage systems.<>reddit_eli5
