Why do people age ? Please try to explain as simply as possible . Explain like I'm five.<>Nothing is perfect . Even our bodies , the result of billions of years of evolution from the simplest single - celled life forms , begin to fail after awhile . All of the things that make our body run , our stomachs , hearts , brains , kidneys , will eventually stop working . But the main thing that causes people to age is their own DNA . All DNA has little bits on the end of it called telomeres . Every time DNA is copied ( this happens every time cells divide ) the telomeres get shorter and shorter . The good thing is that telomeres do n't have anything important in them , so it 's ok . But after the telomeres are gone , the important parts of the DNA start getting lost . This causes many bodily functions to slowly stop working like they are supposed to , and eventually stop working at all .<>Aging is the process of getting older. As we get older, our bodies go through changes that can make us look and feel different. For example, when we are young, our skin is smooth and elastic, but as we age, our skin may become less elastic and we may get wrinkles. Our hair may also turn gray or thin out.\n\nInside our bodies, cells are constantly growing and dividing to help us stay healthy. As we get older, these cells may not divide as quickly or as effectively, which can lead to changes in our bodies and make us more prone to certain health problems.\n\nThere are also other factors that can affect how quickly we age, such as the environment, our diet and exercise habits, and our genetics. Some people may age more quickly or slowly than others based on these factors.\n\nOverall, aging is a natural process that happens to everyone, and it is important to take care of ourselves and stay healthy as we get older.<>reddit_eli5
