What exactly happens when something explodes ? Like when someone blows up C4 . I get that there 's a charging blast that sets it off , but why does that cause an explosion ? Please explain like I'm five.<>There is a ton of stored up chemical energy in the C4 ; when it is detonated , nearly all of it is instantly converted into another form of energy : heat . When something heats up , it expands , and when you have enough thermal energy to vaporize a solid block of substance , the expansion will be massive ; this causes the explosion .<>When something explodes, it means that it is releasing a lot of energy very quickly. C4 is a type of explosive that is used to blow things up because it can release a lot of energy very quickly. When C4 is set off, it starts a chain reaction that causes the C4 to burn very quickly. As it burns, it creates hot gases, which take up a lot of space. These hot gases want to escape, so they push against anything that is around them. This pressure is what causes the explosion. The explosion can be very loud and can also create a shockwave, which is a wave of pressure that travels through the air.<>reddit_eli5
