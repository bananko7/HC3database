How do auto-loan payments factor into taxes for cars that are solely used by dependent(s)?<>I don't see how allowing usage of your vehicle is less support than giving money to buy their own vehicle. If that's the only vehicle your mother has - then you're supporting her. Quantifying that support may be difficult though, but if you are providing her all of her needs - it doesn't matter. If she does have income of her own, I do not think that you can put the actual amount you're paying as part of the calculation towards the 50% rule since she would otherwise have bought a much cheaper car. But if you pass the 50% threshold even without the car payments - then you're fine either way.<>If you are paying off an auto loan for a car that is used solely by your dependent(s), the payments you make on the loan will not be tax deductible. Only business-related vehicle expenses, such as those incurred by self-employed individuals or employees who use their personal vehicles for work, may be deductible on your tax return.However, if you are providing financial support to your dependent(s) and you are claiming them as dependents on your tax return, you may be able to claim a dependency exemption for them. This exemption reduces your taxable income by a certain amount, which can lower your tax bill. To claim a dependency exemption, you must meet certain criteria, such as providing more than half of the dependent's support and being eligible to claim the dependent on your tax return.It's important to note that the rules for claiming dependency exemptions and deducting business-related vehicle expenses can be complex, and you should consult a tax professional or refer to IRS guidelines for more information.<>finance
