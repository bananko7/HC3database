How do scientists know the temperature on the surface of the sun . When the temperature is very high on the surface of the sun than how is it possible that scientists measured it ? Explain like I'm five. <>The color . We know ( because of complicated math ) that certain colors correlate to certain temperatures . Specifically , these colors are wavelengths of light that we can see , and different wavelengths mean different amounts of heat . Think about a candle flame : the blue center of the flame is hotter than the redder - colored outside part . So if a star is bluer , we know it 's hotter ; if it 's redder , we know it 's colder . URL_0<>Scientists use telescopes and special instruments to measure the temperature of the surface of the sun. They don't actually go to the sun to take the temperature, because it is much too hot and dangerous for people to go there. Instead, they use instruments that can measure the amount of heat and light that the sun gives off from far away.\\n\\nOne way they do this is by using telescopes that are equipped with special sensors that can detect the amount of heat coming from the sun. These sensors can measure the temperature of the sun by looking at the amount of heat that is being given off by the sun's surface.\\n\\nAnother way scientists measure the temperature of the sun is by looking at the light that it gives off. Different elements and gases give off different colors of light when they are heated to high temperatures, and by looking at the colors of light that the sun gives off, scientists can tell what elements and gases are present on the sun's surface and how hot they are.\\n\\nSo even though the temperature on the surface of the sun is very high, scientists are able to measure it from a safe distance using special instruments and techniques.<>reddit_eli5
