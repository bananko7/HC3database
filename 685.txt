How Come Books do n't have age restrictions ? Specifically Novels \/ Short Stories etc . Thanks for the responses :) Please explain like I'm five.<>Usually more mature literature will have more complex vocabulary and thus younger audiences are less likely to read it<>Books don't have age restrictions because they are considered a form of free speech, and free speech is protected by the Constitution in the United States. This means that people have the right to read and write whatever they want, as long as it's not breaking any other laws (like laws against violence or hate speech). Some books might have themes or ideas that are more suitable for certain ages, but ultimately it's up to the reader (or the reader's parent or guardian) to decide if a book is right for them. This is because everyone is different and what one person finds interesting or challenging might be different from another person. So, while books don't have age restrictions, it's always a good idea to think about what kind of content is right for you, and to ask for help or guidance if you're not sure.<>reddit_eli5
