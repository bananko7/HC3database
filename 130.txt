How do ( car ) motors work ? And how do they use gasoline to function ? Thanks for helping me out ! Please explain like I'm five.<>This will give you a visual guide to go along with the other comments URL_0<>Sure! A car engine is a machine that converts gasoline into motion. It does this by burning the gasoline in a special container called a cylinder. Inside the cylinder, there is a piston that moves up and down. The burning of the gasoline creates hot gases that push the piston down, and this motion is what powers the car. To use the gasoline, the engine sucks in a mixture of gasoline and air and sprays it into the cylinder. Then, the spark plug creates a spark that ignites the mixture, causing it to burn. This burning creates hot gases that push on the piston, making it move. The motion of the piston is transmitted through the engine to the wheels of the car, which makes the car move. Does that make sense?<>reddit_eli5
