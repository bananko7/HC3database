why do n't porn sites end with .xxx instead of .com ? would it not be more practical and \" child friendly \" ? Please explain like I'm five.<>The .xxx domain only came up a few years ago . Most major porn websites existed long before . They could in theory have their old .com just redirect to an .xxx version , but why bother really ? Nothing stops them continuing as - is .<>The .xxx top-level domain (TLD) was created specifically for the adult entertainment industry. It was intended to be a way for adult content to be separated from other content on the internet and to make it easier for people to identify and avoid content that might not be suitable for them. \nHowever, not all adult content websites have chosen to use the .xxx TLD. Some websites might prefer to use a .com TLD because it is more well-known and familiar to people. Others might use a different TLD for various reasons, such as marketing or branding considerations. \nUsing a .xxx TLD might not necessarily make a website \"child friendly,\" as it is still possible for children to access adult content through other means. It is important for parents to educate their children about internet safety and to use appropriate tools and resources to help protect their children from inappropriate content online.<>reddit_eli5
