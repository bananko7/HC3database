Why does the body suddenly detect itches as soon as it it thinks about itching ? I think this happens to most people . I 'll have no itch , but as soon as I think about being itchy , they pop up all over my body . Please explain like I'm five.<>I heard this explained by the late SN Goenka - founder of Vipassana meditation in the West . He claims it 's not that the thoughts create the itch , it 's just you becoming aware of them at that time . You have a a tremendous amount of sensations occurring all over your body all the time , but your brain filters out stimuli that is consistent ( like how do n't see your nose unless you make a conscious decision to do so ) . Thinking about any stimulus will hone your attention onto that sensation , whether it be itching , heat , the feeling of taking a breath etc<>Itching is a sensation that is caused by certain signals that are sent from your skin to your brain. When you think about itching, your brain sends a message back to your skin telling it to start itching. This can cause you to feel itches all over your body, even if you didn't have any before. It's a bit like when you see someone else scratching and it makes you want to scratch too. It's a way for your body to let you know that something is happening on your skin, and it's usually a sign that something is irritating your skin or that you have an allergic reaction to something.<>reddit_eli5
