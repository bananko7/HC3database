How are sailing vessels able to sail faster than the wind that is propelling them . The title says it all .. Please explain like I'm five.<>You can trim the sails so that the wind flows over them to create a lift , much like an airplane wing , that propels the boat . There is a positive force against the inside of the sail , and a negative force pulling the outside of the sail . Under optimum conditions , the apparent wind is greater than the true wind . ( Apparent wind is the wind you feel on your face as you move forward . True wind is the wind that is blowing naturally ) URL_0<>Sure! When you sail a boat, the wind pushes against the sails. The wind also pushes against the boat itself, but the boat is much heavier than the sails, so it doesn't move as much. The wind moves the sails, and the sails then push the boat forward. Because the boat is much heavier than the sails, it doesn't move as much as the sails do when the wind blows against them. This is why the boat can sail faster than the wind. Does that make sense?<>reddit_eli5
