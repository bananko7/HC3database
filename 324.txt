why is the mouse cursor tilted to the left ? The cursor could have just pointed straight up or may be to the right . How did it come to be to the left ? Any specific purpose fulfilled ? Please explain like I'm five.<>back when screen resolutions where much smaller , the mouse cursor took up precious real estate on the screen , having it tilted to one side kept it from blocking the very button \/ icon you were attempting to click on .<>The mouse cursor is tilted to the left for a very simple reason: it's easier to see which way the cursor is pointing that way. When the cursor is straight up, it can be hard to tell which direction it's pointing, especially if you're using it to select text or move objects around on the screen. Tilting the cursor to the left makes it easier to see which way it's facing, which makes it easier to use. There's no specific purpose that it fulfills, it's just a design choice that makes the cursor easier to use.<>reddit_eli5
