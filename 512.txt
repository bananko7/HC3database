it 's 2015 why do n't window wipers wipe the whole windshield ? If the little triangle could go away that would be great . Please explain like I'm five.<>The cost of developing a system that covers more is n't worth it at this point . The unwiped portions are outside the main viewing area so they 're not a danger . For years Mercedes had an articulating single wiper system that covered a good percentage more than the traditional dual wipers . I can only guess , but I suspect the extra expense of that system just was n't worth it .<>The reason why windshield wipers don't wipe the whole windshield is because they are designed to follow the curve of the windshield. This is done so that the wipers can effectively remove rain and other debris from the surface of the windshield without leaving any streaks or smudges. \nThe small triangle that is left unwiped is usually located at the very top of the windshield, near the driver's side. This area is often difficult for the wipers to reach because it is close to the edge of the windshield and the wiper blades may not be long enough to reach it. \nIn some cases, it may be possible to adjust the wipers or replace them with longer blades to improve their coverage. However, it is important to keep in mind that the wipers are an important safety feature and making any changes to them could potentially affect their performance.<>reddit_eli5
