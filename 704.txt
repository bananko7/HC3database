Why ca n't someone be shocked back to life by a defibrillator like in movies ? It 's often said on Reddit that this can not happen like it does in movies but why not ? Please explain like I'm five.<>A defibrillator ' resets ' a heart in a way . If you have a bad rhythm , it stops it ( hopefully ) , so that it can start back up with a correct rhythm . If your heart has * stopped , * something is wrong with it . Maybe it is damaged , has insufficient supply , and so on . Trying to stop it * harder * does n't fix the problem . Defibrillators do n't repair hearts .<>Defibrillators are used to try to restart a person's heart when it is not beating correctly. In movies, they often show someone being \"shocked\" back to life with a defibrillator, but in real life it is not quite that simple.A defibrillator gives a strong electrical shock to the heart through patches placed on a person's chest. This shock can sometimes restart the heart's normal rhythm. However, it is not always successful and does not work in every situation.Sometimes, a person's heart cannot be restarted with a defibrillator because there is not enough oxygen in the brain and other organs. This can happen if a person's heart has not been beating for a long time. When this happens, the person may not recover even if their heart starts beating again.Defibrillators can be very helpful in saving lives, but they are not always successful. It is important to call 911 right away if someone is unconscious or not breathing, so that they can get the medical help they need as soon as possible.<>reddit_eli5
